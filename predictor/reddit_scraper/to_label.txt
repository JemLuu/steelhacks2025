  "depression": [
    "Therapist explained to me that normally people aren’t exhausted all day, they’re motivated, and don’t spend all night worried and dreading the next day. This has destroyed me. I’ve always thought maybe “severely depressed” like I’ve always been told on tests and stuff was extreme. Like, surely I’m at most moderately, maybe just a little depressed, like everyone is, right? But what the fuck? People get out of bed excited for the day? I thought hobbies were just finding a way to pass the time with something atleast somewhat bearable. I can’t believe people enjoy stuff. Like, it sounds like people live their day to day life like I spend a night drunk.",
    "“It gets better” No it doesn’t.. I’m tired of people saying this to me. I’m tired of my therapist saying this to me because it fucking doesn’t. College really kick started depression for me. I didn’t get on it or take it seriously in high school and let it fester, now I don’t even know if I’ll be able to graduate before I kill myself. And I don’t have any support system, my friends look at me weirdly when I express anything other than my happy-jokey persona. My therapist and I don’t meet frequently enough to actually do something. So no, it doesn’t get better. It’s been 3 years and not a damn thing has gotten better.",
    "I’m a joke. I was raped and I came here for advice. I’m a straight guy and I was raped by another guy, so I got a lot of jokes about my sexuality. They kept telling me I’m closeted and I wanted it. It destroyed my marriage and my wife “outed” me to all our family and friends. And I’m not even gay. I don’t have anyone I can turn to. I feel alone. And I don’t know how to fix this. I’m not homophobic, but I’m not gay. And now the whole world thinks I am. It’ll affect any future relationships I might have and I don’t know if anyone will believe I’m straight anymore. I’m a joke. And I feel ashamed and embarrassed. I am getting some support, but it’s 50/50 positive and negative responses. I guess I’m naive, but I thought people would be more sympathetic. I’m disappointed but not surprised. I knew I would get a handful of rude responses but I wasn’t expecting this. And I’m not sure how to deal with it.",
    "Life isn’t meant for everyone including me. im not suicidal but Its not just depression, i dont like life or living. Its all too much work. Things to get, relationships. They all are too much work for me to invest in them. All the work for things that make me happy makes me unhappy. I’m kinda just existing. Realistically not staying alive would be a better option but i dont want to ruin my moms life by it so im trapped existing like a prison sentence. Ive never enjoyed life much except the rare times i have no work to do. I dont want anything from life tbh. Im over life. I have not lived long but i have seen enough already. *fyi i dont need a crises hotline just venting*",
    "I tried killing myself yesterday. It was the most scariest thing that happened to me. i puked at least 30 or more times last night. I was scared to die even though it was supposed to be a suicide attempt. I just felt very suicidal yesterday people are right overdosing is a bad way to go out I just need a hug right now I took 30,000 of pain reliever that's 50 pills I must be very strong to survive that. Am I going to die? My stomach feels a bit sick right now. And I work an 8 hour shift today. And I cut my wrist yesterday, too. I'm going to have a bad day today.",
    "How do people not suffer from depression?. Do they not feel hopelessness in their life, when they see the state of the world? Are they simply ignorant, or am I too pessimistic? Do most people just have their life together? With ambitions, and hobbies they wish to persue; friends and family they know they can depend on? When I see, everyone else around me so care-free and confident, I can't help but to think that maybe I'm not supposed to make it that far. My only options are to stay suffering for years on end and die a lonely failure, or to take mercy on myself and die, pitied for 'dying too young.'",
    "Saying “please don’t” isn’t a solution to suicidal feelings. I don’t want to type a post I just wanted yall to stop commenting the same meaningless shit, it really doesn’t help",
    "I feel.. Braindead. It's like I have no soul. I have no interest in anything and can't bring myself to do anything. Everything feels like too much work. I can't think straight and feel like I'm going crazy half the time. Not sure if this aligns with depression or not anymore. I'm starting to think my brain is lowering its intelligence as time goes by.",
    "I'm exercising regularly, dieting religiously, working hard, getting sunlight every day, and and have even started seeing a councilor. I'm not even a little happier.. I actually keep getting sadder as time goes on. 3 years ago I used to collapse randomly from depression and a lack of energy/willingness to keep standing. It's started happening again.",
    "my friend went on a rant about how depression isn’t real. almost flipped shit on him.. my sister was hanging out with me and my friend, and she brought up how she’s going to get a tattoo relating to depression. then my friend started saying “depression isn’t real, it’s just something people think they have when they have a bad life. all you need to do when you think you have depression is go to the gym, and when you start seeing results and get jacked, you won’t have depression anymore because you will see progress and that will make you happy and then you won’t have depression anymore” and said a bunch of shit that just pissed me off and i just didn’t say anything the whole time. then at the end he said “so do you agree with me?” and i said “no i don’t actually.” and he said “well what don’t you agree about? tell me what your personal definition of depression is. it’s just long term sadness right? so all you need to do is do things that make you happy. and if anxiety is causing depression, all you need to do is find out what’s making you anxious, and that’s it.” and i just said i don’t want to talk about this right now. and he still tried pressing me about it. so i said no im not fucking talking about this. and he stopped. but fuck i was so ready to kick his ass out of my house. telling a person with depression and terrible anxiety this bullshit. like do you think if it was that easy i would be struggling with this shit for years? you think this is my fucking choice? i fucking hate people. so fucking done. cant even talk to my own friend about my issues or he brushes it off saying it’s my fault.",
    "I hate doctors. Went to a doctor appointment for depression and anxiety, basically called me a retard and said I can probably barely spell my name. And then I started crying and he said “tears get you nowhere”, yeah thanks, I forgot crying is something you just consciously decide to do. Basically called me a leech and a good for nothing bc I’m not working, and I’m a shitty person for depending on my family. So anyway, I relapsed hard. Would it be petty to attempt out of anger? I’m so pissed, I’m literally one of the most intelligent people I know, just because I sucked at high school doesn’t mean I’m a fucking idiot. And he basically treated me like nothing, I’m officially over trusting people ever. I said I wanted a stable job, and he basically just laughed at me. I’m so close to just killing myself since all my dreams and passions are apparently unreachable",
    "Die where no one can find you. Anybody feeling this way? I just want it to seem like I just disappeared. I don't want to hurt the ones I will leave behind. I'm planning to do this after I sette all the debts that I made throughout the years.",
    "I survived a suicide attempt, where do i go from now?. Yesterday i took a shit ton of xanax pills and sip alot of vodka. My parebts found me got me to the hospital on time, i'm still alive i guess. It feels weird, i feel like i should have died and didn't. I don't where to start or if i should start anything i just feel to sick to kms again, because it felt weird af, but all my other options are painful now, still no hope, or enjoyment of life, any advice? Edit. Thank you all for taking your time to reply and try to help me, i'll be reading and replying as many as i can",
    "How can I forgive myself for wasting so much time?. Even if by some miracle and inordinate amounts of hard work I manage to turn my life around now, I'm still crushed by the knowledge that I wasted my 20s doing nothing, gaining nothing. I might as well have been in prison for a decade. People will parrot empty platitudes: \"The 40s are the new 30s!\", \"When you're 70 you'll give everything to go back to being 30!\" But the truth is I let my sexual prime go by. I let what should've been the best years of my life go by. What's the point of starting over now? I don't actually *want* to die. I want a time machine. But in lieu of that, I'll take dying.",
    "Life is pointless and everyday is torture. Why do people even want to live, just because it’s all they’ve ever known that’s why, people suck the life out of you, society sucks the life out of you, there’s no point in any of it, I made a stupid promise a few months back that I wouldn’t kill myself, I promised god and said if I do he can just send me to hell (stupid, i know, it was late at night) I’ve never regretted anything more in my life, Im just meant to die young, I’m meant to kill myself, I want to, I can’t stay here it’s just wrong it’s all wrong, I hate waking up everyday EDIT: I made this as just a random rant post but surprisingly many people related to it, I’ve found my people 🙏🙏",
    "I'm done living. I'm ending it.. Needed a place to vent because I have no friends. I'm female. Going to be 34 this year. Been a Christian for all my life and just this morning I gave up believing in God. I have autism and adhd. I grew up with drug addict parents. I was emotionally, mentally and sexually abused by my father. My mother was never there. Growing up was a challenge because I was alone. Now I live with an elderly family member who broke her ankle and now I must care for her. My mom lives with us. She's currently in the hospital for bone cancer. My sibling is also autistic. We also live with a narcissistic cousin who doesn't work and just wants people to kiss his ass. I know everyone struggles, but I feel so alone and I don't know what to do. I work and go home. That's it. I feel like my future will just be me caring for a mother who was never there for me. I just don't know where to turn to for help. I told myself if this year doesn't get better that I'm killing myself.",
    "If you don’t relate to depressed people, why are you here?. I don't understand these non-depressed people who keep track of posts on this sub just to harshly criticize people. Do these people really think that's a smart thing to do with people on the verge of their breaking point? Or are they just sadistic?",
    "my boyfriend will kill himself in a few days. hello everyone. this is a follow up post to a post that i made about a month ago. the situation, even though i took all of the advice that i got, did not improve. it worsened and i dont know what to do. im really lost and scared. to sum up the last post that i made, my boyfriend (20) has been feeling like his whole life is a waste and like he doesn't exist in anyone's life. he feels that he wasted his teenage years and that life won't get better, only worse, with all of the responsibilities that life brings. he doesn't want to grow old and doesn't want to accept the fact that all of his life was just emptiness. no good memories no bad memories just emptiness. no experience / no new memories in the present nor in the future can help him change the way he sees his life. it is all a waste of time and he doesnt want to continue living in this agony. i took all the advice that i got. i am always there for him, im here to listen, im checking up on him, encouraging him to go out, to do things with me, to do things he enjoys, i help him take his mind off things, i am optimistic but not in a overwhelming way, i always understand everything he says. i surrounded him with new people who like him, i spoke to him about plans about the future or some trips we could take in the near future to change the environment. i got him to go to a psychiatrist, which i all planned out like advised, but he didn't like it. the psychiatrist didn't even listen to him, was basically a bitch towards him and the whole appointment lasted for about 25 minutes because they fucked up the appointments. he took this as a sign that even people who are paid wont listen to him. he doesn't want to go anymore. not to that clinic not anywhere. doesn't want to waste money on himself anymore, refuses to take my money to go. public clinics are off the table for him. because of this he cant get any medication prescribed. at this point, i think that he wouldn't even take it if it was prescribed. i told him to talk to his friends that i know love him dearly, but he refuses. he is 100% sure that nobody cares for him and that \"nobody would even come to his funeral\". he said that he can't enjoy anything anymore and that his brain is full of thoughts of his wasted life and if anything nice happens, all he can think about is \"why didnt this happen earlier\" or \"what did i do to deserve this life\" he gave himself another week. i wouldn't be writing this if i was not 100% sure that he would do it. this is not a cry for help. this will happen if i don't do something to help. and i dont know how and what to do. i cant call the suicide prevention line on him because it wont do any good. i cant do anything my hands are tied and i dont know what to do. please tell me how to help him. any advice is appreciated. thank you. im sorry if some things i wrote did not make sense im just scared.",
    "Being socially anxious is a death sentence. I fucking hate being socially anxious I hate that I was born extremely fucking ugly and nobody wants to be seen with me I hate being told to \"get over it\" by normal people who don't feel genuinely sick when they have to socialize or give presentations I hate always being paired up with the special needs kids because the teachers know I'm too shy to argue (no hate to the kids its just fucking humiliating) I hated being called racial and misogynistic shit by my classmates and not being able to tell them to fuck off or tell a teacher I hate having a normal, talented family and being the only fucking retarded piece of shit who can't act normal because I was cursed with social anxiety I hate knowing I'm a fucking dissapointment to my parents because they've wasted so much time and money on me but all my other siblings are successful and have lots of friends and I just cry and act depressed all the time I hate knowing that I'll never succeed in this society no matter how kind i am to others or how hard I try because I'm ugly and don't have any fucking confidence I fucking hate being alive fuck this life I wish I had the courage to just end it all (Sorry for the reposts I'm not sure what the karma requirements are",

    "I cannot stop thinking. I cannot stop thinking.. Every waking moment I spend thinking. I think about every mistake. I think about every success. I think of how few successes I have to think about. I think about my peers. I think I am behind. I think I am lesser. I think I am less worthy. I think I am a screw-up. I think about my family. I think about me being a bad child. I think about me being a bad sibling. I think about me having been a bad lover. I think about being a sex-addict. I think about my expressions of love. I think about how its all physical. I think about how I crave the very thing I reject. I think about how pathetic and small I am. I think about the scale of this universe. I think about my insignificance in the grand scheme of it all. I think about the meaning of life. I think about how it is not worthwhile to live. I think about my suicide attempt. I think about my family, again. I think about how a parent should never have to mourn their dead child. I think about how a parent should never have to worry about their depressed child. I think about the comedy in making a grand gesture like committing suicide just for no one to find out. I think about how I want to stop thinking. I think about how I want to die. I think about how I want to stop thinking. I think about how I'd go about making myself die. I think about how I want to stop thinking. I think about how I could jump in front of the train tomorrow on my way to work. I think about how I want to stop thinking. I think about how I want to stop thinking.

    "I asked my friend how old would she want to become? Her answer showed me I’m not normal. She’s like “I’d like to live for as long as possible. I wanna become as old as I can get” My answer: somewhere in my 70s. Actually 50s if I don’t have kids. Her answer reminded me WANTING to live is normal. A lot of people, even though their life isn’t perfect, have an innate desire to be alive and remain so Me however, I never connected with life and I don’t think I ever have. I’m 28. I’m doing okay for the most part but I never felt like I have this attachment to life which is why I can say I wouldn’t mind dying relatively young. Although I have had some suicidal thoughts before I could never do it and it’s against my religion She also told me about some scary dreams she has where she is attacked or there is a shooter somewhere and she dies. I rarely have those dreams. I genuinely don’t feel like I care if that happens to me? Isn’t that horrible. If it’s my time to it’s my time to go I guess I never liked this thing called life. Is it even depression when you have always felt like this? Pretty much born this way.",
    "Excessive nostalgia as a symptom of depression?. As I get older, I’m starting to become more aware of the telltale signs that my depression symptoms are getting worse. I’ve noticed that one very specific symptom is that I feel nostalgic about so many things. In a melancholy way, not a fun way. I think it’s my brain’s way of trying to comfort me by flooding me with memories of pleasant times. However, the memories often make me feel sad and empty when I contrast them with how my life is now. I even sometimes feel sad when I’m doing something pleasant because I worry that it will be a long time before I get to do something pleasant again. This obviously makes it really hard for me to enjoy the moment. I’ve been practicing mindfulness, I’ve been to therapy, and I tried bupropion, but I had problems with the side effects, so I’m not currently medicated. I guess I just wondered if anyone else has noticed excessive sentimentality or nostalgia as a precursor to a depressive episode.",
    "Shoutout to those of us who can't cry &lt;3. Everybody experiences and copes with depression differently. Personally I can't cry. I get teary eyed and lose a tear here and there (mostly because of sad things I see/hear and not really my own pain tho). I feel the gut wrenching pain of depression. The despair, the heaviness, the tight chest. I just can't cry and that's okay. Not crying doesn't mean we're not experiencing depression. To anyone out there who is experiencing the same thing: I see you and you are just as valid as anyone else. Be kind to yourself &lt;3",

    "How do people with chronic depression manage to date?. I’d like to get some insights and advice from people who’ve been struggling with depression for the majority of their lives. How do you take that first step into the dating world without feeling like you have to hide it so that the other person won’t leave you once they see you for who you really are? I imagine having a strong circle of friends and family helps but unfortunately not everyone has that. Also it feels like modern dating is all about looking for a reason to eliminate someone based on their perceived shortcomings, and I find dating as a man is already difficult enough as it is without having a mental illness. I’m at a loss here and I can’t shake this impending sense of doom. Anything will help. I feel stuck and I don’t know what to do. I don’t “feel” the world anymore.",

I'm diagnosed with chronic depression disorder, C-PTSD, agoraphobia, and many other issues. You're wishing to die, every single day like I do, openly and accusing me of all your misfortune, rejecting me and my step-sis, who's quite like me. You abused us and made us who we are. You failed as a parent and you're failing to give us the will to live by our own. I have no will, no strenght, because of your parasitic madness. Screaming and beating my dad. Who got 3 strokes and developped blatant signs of dementia. You're making our life, miserable. My dad needs to get hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital or specialized hospital for the elderly, crazy people. You need to see a therapist, like I'm trying to do. You need to stop pushing me over the cliff, each day, threatening me almost every day of committing suicide. You've given me life to keep me as a toy. You broke me, and the world broke me.

It’s a constant loop of hurt, hurt, hurt - and repeat. It’s exhausting. I didn’t use to be like this, I absolutely am a product of my environment and life experiences. People made me hate myself, even when I was just trying to love them. There’s just too much evil all around to deal with. What’s the point? I thought about moving somewhere, into a middle of nowhere, but even that wouldn’t help. Even if I was completely alone, with no one who could hurt me, I would not have peace. My past has left too much of a stain on my mind for it to be alleviated, and the hatred is too deeply ingrained into my soul now. It’s a cruel world and I don’t want to be a part of it anymore.",

I'm soon to be 34 and I got a very nice raise from work at the beginning of the year, but the goal post keeps getting moved out of reach. I'm a failure with a college degree. I'm stressed all of the time and I have suicidal thoughts at least 3-4 days out of the week. I bought a rope several months ago and my husband made a big deal about it when he found it, so now I've been better at keeping it all to myself. Now he thinks everything is fine and he doesn't care anymore. Nobody does. I feel like I'm an empty shell that's been deteriorating inside for the past year and a half and there's nothing left.

    "my experience in my suicide attempt (which I survived) yikes. Basically I couldn't take it anymore, and the main thought was that the medications don't work at all and I swallowed 80 medications, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, analgesics, clonazepam, among others that I don't remember. The moment I did what I did I remember lying in bed and I lost consciousness. In my head I seriously thought I had died and I was in a place where everything was white and there was nothing, I wanted God to be there but there was nothing. Outside, my sister tells me that when they found me, I got out of bed and threw myself on the floor, I was in zombie mode. All this happening at the same time. In the end they took me to the doctor who obviously admitted me, but I felt like it was all for nothing.

I’m f23 my sister is 16yr cut her wrist today but thankfully we were able to get her to the hospital and she’s very fine but something extremely weird happened so a little backstory my sister was caught talking to boys in an inappropriate way five years ago we live in a very strict muslim household so when my mom found out she hit her very hard she also took her phone and any electronics and when she finally returned them after 2 or three years she never stopped spying on her and sending my younger siblings to see what’s shes doing alone in her romm and that always bothered my younger sister because she always told me that why would her younger brothers be knowing about her business and that would affect he role as an older sister and honestly i agreed with her and talked to my mom about it and we ended up agreeing that what she did was wrong and she shouldn’t send my younger siblings to spy on my sister so anyways today my mom told her to bring her phone but instead of going upstairs and taking it she sent my brother and then she was bothered that my sister changed her password (she told me why andshe had every right to change it) but my mom as usual didn’t listen and had a fight with her after a while my sister went upstairs then came back bleeding from her wrist and told my mom she accidentally hurt herself my mom did something so cruel I swear i cry every time i remember it she told her you did this mistake you fix it i was shocked and mad so i went and took her upstairs to get cleaned up, change my pjs and go to the hospital then my mom came and honestly I don’t know how I’ve never done that before but i screamed so loudly at her and she screamed and my sister was apologizing and crying and my fucking mom started crying and saying I’m very sick and i have your younger brothers to raise and why did you do this to me which I genuinely felt like wtf this isn’t about you and i kept telling her get your shit together this isn’t the time she’s bleeding and my mom was too scared and crying hysterically saying they could lock me up for this and blah blah blah anyways she finally got up took her and stitched her wounds im sorry for the very long story buti have read about narcissistic behaviors and she matched alot of them so if she is what do i do now im so worried about my younger sister coz she’s been literally living in hell and my mom always tell my other sister(21) to go check and spy on her and since i study abroad she’s much closer with my s21 sister so i feel like sometimes they gang up on my 16yo sister what do i do😞 also while she was screaming and saying how could you do tis to me when we were upstairs she took my sisters phone and crashed it on the floor my sister told me later that it wasn’t because there was anything on the phone and that she always did that secretly but this time she accidentally went deeper",

    "I don’t want to be alone anymore :(. Anyone feel like being miserable together? I’m heartbroken over a relationship my ex already moved on from. I don’t understand how he did it so fast. But now I need a new person too… I don’t want to be alone. I’m posting in here because I know whoever reads it will likely share some of my struggles, and while two mentally ill folks trying to pursue a relationship is often cause for disaster, I don’t think I could be with anyone… neurotypical, for lack of a better word. I don’t want to be sad over my ex anymore. I don’t want to keep harming myself. I don’t want to try and take my life again. I just want someone to love me and someone to love completely, unconditionally, forever. I intend to hold on and never let go. Idk if this sort of post is allowed. But if you are in your mid 20s-30s, and want to see if there is a spark between us, I encourage you to reach out. I need someone to talk to. I need someone to love. I don’t think I can survive too long without that. Pics of me on my profile if that’s something that matters to you.",

    "Trapped in a world where nothing works. Anyone ever feel this way? Ive lost every job ive ever had Ive never had any real money Drug + gambling + porn addictions Been admitted to Mental hospital 3 times Been to jail 12 times Cant find love Dont have any friends Fail at every attempt at connecting to others Not talented Not social Low energy And when i did finally get a friend, she was murdered not long after☹️ Thankfully i have a good family. But i almost pissed that away due to my drug issues, so much that i lived homeless for 3 years after i lost my friend and couldnt take it anymore. Got addicted to alcohol and crack. Went to jail like 6 times. Got out and now im back home. But still, no matter how much i try or what i try, nothing happens. Ever. I feel like i actually died in a past life and this is my hell. Everything feels somehow broken. And the funny thing is i was a good kid growing up. I played sports, was decent looking, in shape. Everyone knew me as the smart guy. I never thought in a million years i would grow up to be the worst possible version of myself. So im constantly wondering what i did to deserve this. At what point did i do something so wrong that the world decided i should achieve nothing. I never wished hurt on anybody and had a healthy upbringing. I just dont understand.☹️",

    "What's the point of staying in a world that's so horrible anyways. People say you need a support system for your mental health. What if the earth is just full of assholes? I have had \"friends\" abandon me because of my depression. They always say \"I'm here if you need someone to talk to\" but the minute it gets too deep or they find out your depression is chronic and not just some slight sadness they go out of the door. If you are too depressed to even work, you'll just be a problem worker who \"never has energy\". I've been a victim of workplace narcissism because of my depression. Even when trying my best, it would never be enough. This world is so artificial and fake. If you don't bring anything to the table people treat you like nothing. It's never enough. I do struggle to make friends in real life, but part of the reason why I am alone is because finding people who are genuinely kind and care is like finding a needle in a haystack. When you're already tried, who has the energy or motivation to even look through the haystack ?!",

No matter what social media gurus all these fake \"health and beauty\" or hard work and quotes pages say, I think aging and retiring is a curse those are not \"golden years\" Remember kids, work hard your whole life miss out on partying, vacationing, dating, having friends and just slave away then when you are 70 you can finally retire. Except! your looks fade, you will have no hair, a plethora of health problems, alzheimers, your body can't perform like it did in your 20s or 30s, you have no energy to party or go on trips, most of the adults in your family will be gone, you may be put in a nursing home where no one will visit you etc. all there is to do is go on morning walks and stare at a wall waiting for the clock to run out. Why are people so brainwashed into thinking this is the big dream how the fuck do you look at this and say \"yeah awesome I can't wait\" I hope I don't make it to 40 maybe even 30 when I say that I am not suicidal nor referring to it I just hope something happens like an unfortunate accident or a disease.

So i responded with \"yeah thats why i want to kill myself. Its too cruel for me, especially the money parts\". I didnt really think about it. Im usually very careful to avoid admitting to these feelings. The trouble it causes isnt worth it. The more people who know means more chances to stop me too. So its better to keep it quiet if i do commit. Anyways, they were totally stunned and freaked out! \"How could you possibly think about that!!! Life is beautiful and a blessing! Its not all about money you need to slow down and just relax!\" I didnt say anything. Just empty lies that im not suicidal. I am, i literally have been depressed and suicidal since i was 12 years old lmao. Im 24 now. So 12 years of it so far. What really got on my nerves is like... which is it then? Is life cruel and unfair, demanding a stoic acceptance of its terriblness and to grow up and accept that... or is it beautiful and a blessing?? It cant be both. Life is cruel.

Any time one manages to reach the surface, depression will quickly recapture it and punish it for even existing. At this point, my feelings of hope are all but dead. Happiness is given just enough free time to begin to enjoy life before the warden slams the cell shut and whips come back out. Anger, that's the warden's pet and he's free to do what he wants. The others, they all share a tiny cell and, at this point, have become so tangled you can't tell them apart. I can't keep living this way. I'm not alive.",

    "Noticing how severe my social skills have regressed after self-isolation.. I’m feeling quite frustrated with myself right now. I just got back from an event that required a lot of socializing. While I was there, I was observing myself interacting with people and I just felt so … unhappy with myself. I found it hard to use my words, I’d constantly space out, I didn’t know how to carry myself at all. I was with one of my best friends of almost twenty years, and I still felt uncomfortable with her. It’s not that she was making me uncomfortable, but I just didn’t know how to act. It’s been a while since I’d been around a lot of people. And a lot has been going on in my inner world that I feel like I’d forgotten who I am outside of my head. This is my third year living completely independently, and I thought I had gotten used to it. But a chain of events at work caused me to spiral into self-isolation and eventually severe depression and anxiety. My perception of myself is currently shattered right now and I don’t know what to do. I saw a lot of people from the past, who I mostly hadn’t seen since before the lockdowns. So it’s really been a while. I was struggling to know how to be myself in front of them, because the “me” they knew from before feels so far away from me now. I was super conscious about what I’d say, and it felt like I couldn’t say anything because I really have just been too depressed to do much of anything. I have no major life updates, and the simple “how are you?” feels so… hard to answer. I was racking my brain for the last piece of information I knew about them so I could ask about it. Idk. It’s just frustrating and I really just wanted to get it off my chest.",

Recently, I was cleaning up my bookshelf and found old notes written by 10yr old me. I was still the depressed little shit even back then. It's not like I haven't tried, it's just that it's never enough. I am tired of being here, in this place, in my skin with this brain that I have. I am tired of this world that I live in. I feel like I am an outcast even among outcasts. Don't get me wrong, I am a functioning member of society. I can talk and interact with people. I wear this mask and I play the part perfectly but I crumble completely everytime I get home. I sleep wishing I don't wake up again.

Weeks ago, when my professor assigned me to a group project, i found out that my group was forced to take me in because no one wanted to volunteer to take me. I asked my professor why and they said that everyone doesn't like me and hated my existence for being a loner. I just realized that this isn't the first time it had happened. It also happened to me from kindergarten until now. I guess i was being oblivious and clueless until now. The truth is painful to me that everyone genuinely doesn't like me and everytime i socialize with them, it felt they were uncomfortable with me. Although i was being nice with them and polite all the time, they just wanted to stayed away from me. No matter what i do, i just made people feel uncomfortable. I tried to change, i tried to be more casual, i respected everyone's boundaries, and I'm still getting hated for it. I'm sorry for the rant, It's depressing for me to find out the truth the hard way.

No. It won’t fucking be okay and it never will be. I’ve been on a downward spiral since 8th grade and I’m tired of people saying shit like that Don’t even get me started on “It gets better”. How? How exactly does it get better? Be specific please because I won’t just wake up one morning and I’ll be happy, I’ll be sad I didn’t die in my sleep unless something specifically good happened that day like an album dropping or something. Plus I need to work to get better, and I have zero motivation to do anything besides sit on my ass all day and be a truant. And ohhh boy I love it when I make vent posts about my depression and somebody mentions how I’m too young and need to get help or whatever. Like fuck off dude seriously. All that does is just invalidate my feeling even further and make me feel like shit. On the topic of getting help, the fuck do you mean “get help”? Antidepressants? Fuck that shit. I don’t need a pill to put me in a fantasy world where everything is just fine and dandy. I at least want to be my authentic self and all a shitty pill will do is just make it a facade. Fuck I don’t even know who I am without depression but whatever. Therapists? The fuck is a therapist gonna do for me? Nothing, that’s what.

    "Sleep, the cousin of death.. In the quiet embrace of sleep, I surrender to a darkness that feels more like home than any waking moment where the weight of existence slips away, and the haunting echoes of loneliness fade into nothingness. In this stillness, I find an almost serene acceptance of a life lived in the shadows, devoid of the warmth of connection, as if I am a ghost drifting through a world of vibrant souls, forever unseen and untouched. Life loses meaning when the heart knows only solitude, and I wonder if perhaps peace is found not in the living, but in the gentle release of letting go. May I fall asleep for the last time",

We are waiting for the day everything will turn around. Like in a movie where the main character has a ton of setbacks but ends up being happy and wins. Isn’t this what we are told through popular media ? Your suffering is part of a greater cause, you will be happy one day, things get better, etc, etc. Unfortunately they don’t for a lot of us.

I live near a subway station and this morning i wrote my suicide note, put it in my pocket and as i walked outside and saw the train passing, i started balling my eyes out because it was moving too slow and i definitely wouldn’t die. I guess thats something. I had to laugh out loud while typing this because of how ridiculous this logic is, but thats the truth lol. Im getting on antidepressants today. I made an emergency appointment with my doctor. I have officially tried everything, all the mindfulness in the world cant make this pit of paralyzing pain i have about all the people who have sucked my energy out and abandoned me and all the pain that has caused me to feel this way. I dont think anything else can help at this point. I am suicidal and all my energy is gone. I want it back and its just Not there. I hope antidepressants will help. If anyone can tell me if they did help for them that would be great. Im just sitting here all depleted bc my energy is gone. Edit: Thank you everyone for replying! I really appreciate all the responses. I went to my doctor last night and got the perscription, im staying with my sister whos a doctor over the next few weeks while i start taking them to see how i feel, wish me luck! I feel the same as how i felt before i tried to end my life yesterday, but im staying strong and holding on, hoping these antidepressants will help!

    "My father killed my mother when I was three months old. Life sucks.. My father killed my mother when I was three months old. My sister and I were adopted by our aunt and grandmother, but my father came back to live with us after spending seven years in a psychiatric hospital. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and released, but honestly, he was never a good person. While it's easy to blame the mental illness, he had a long history of emotional abuse towards women—my aunt, his sister, being one of his targets. Not to mention he still causes us many problems with money and everything. I’ve always known what my father did, even before I could fully understand it. Growing up, I overheard whispers, and I feel like I've subconsciously internalized the truth. Also, when I was five, one of my maternal aunts shouted what he did to me and my sister during a moment of rage, so there's also that. I've been carrying this trauma with me for years. I developed harm OCD, terrified of becoming like him. Intrusive thoughts consumed me. While my primary obsession has been about not wanting to turn out like him, I’ve always had these obsessive tendencies, even as a child. Whether it was about illness, superstition, or anything else, my brain latched on. Panic attacks followed, but anxiety was nothing new to me—I’ve been anxious for as long as I can remember. It’s like I’ve lived with this constant sense of dread, fear, and emptiness that slowly drained my spirit. By the time I became a teenager, I was completely apathetic - although I looked normal on the outside. I completely stopped engaging in my passions (like writing, or creating in general), and studying (I was top of my class in middle school). And while my aunt and grandmother took care of us and made sacrifices, they’ve also been the cause of a lot of my anxiety and depression. My aunt, especially, tends to guilt-trip me over everything and reacts with yelling and emotional abuse whenever I make even the smallest mistake. I can't even go out and live my life without feeling like I’m doing something wrong because of their old-fashioned, rigid ideals. I feel stuck. Every task, whether it’s studying, making my bed, or picking up an object, feels like climbing a mountain. I’m either overwhelmed with pain, drowning in anxiety, or completely numb. Just when I think I’m getting better, I spiral back into that dark hole. I can’t take it anymore. My life feels unbearable—nothing seems to go right. My relationship is uncertain because my partner struggles mentally just as much as I do. I hate how I look so much that seeing a photo of myself makes me feel sick. I even got involved in politics, and it just made things worse. I’m constantly reminded of how messed up the system is, and I dread the thought of working 40 hours a week at a job I’ll probably hate. Everything feels wrong. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this.",

    "I've realized that I'm one of the creepiest person anybody will ever meet in their life. I've recently noticed that I'm one of those creepy people you see. That one person who doesn't have anything going on in his life at all, he doesn't talk to girls because when he does, the things that comes out of his mouth disgust them. The kind that will stalk his crush may it be through social media or real life. Yep, that's the kind of person I am, a freaky creep. I've always hated people like me, only to one day realize that I'm just like those people. If I was someone else, I'd want me to die the most painful death imaginable. Although, I feel the same way even just being me right now. I don't know what to do, am I mentally insane? Am I just not okay in the head? Why am I like this? Did I get into the wrong friend group? What did I do to become like this? Or am I just born this way, one of those people who rightfully deserves to die. Can I even change? No matter what I do, I can't stop being disgusting and I'm scared it's only a matter of time that I become a criminal. The things I do and say makes a girl vomit and even made my close friends keep their distance with me. I don't have a place in society. I don't even deserve a seat and to be served by a waiter/waitress in any restaurant. I'm not good in anything, I'm very clumsy, I'm very stupid, no matter what I do I will fail. If only everyone in my life decides to leave me and go off somewhere else, I'd be much happier taking my life, that's all I want right now. There won't be anyone sad over the death of a society's trash",
    "I think I’m going to die soon. Hey guys. Life has been kicking my ass more and more by the day. To give you guys a little background, I’ve been mentally ill for about 8 years now. Possibly longer but my first attempt was 8 years ago. I’ve been extremely depressed for so long and extremely fucked in the head. I’ve “tried” to commit suicide over 20 times but I only consider a couple of those genuine attempts. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder 5 years ago and life has not gotten better since then. My teens were spent in and out of the psych ward, doing a whole lot of different programs and experimenting with a whole lot of different meds. Fast forward to this year, my depression of course was still here and standing strong. I was living with my abusive ex boyfriend and of course that made it so much worse. He finally moved out and out of my life 7 months ago and slowly but surely I got better mentally. I’m pretty sure I just became really good at ignoring my depression and pretending I was happy just to prevent myself from spiraling yet again. Ever since he moved out I’ve been struggling financially. I know it’s stupid but I never planned on paying these bills on my own. I was forced to move causing me to rush into getting an apartment. Now that he’s gone I have all these bills that I absolutely cannot afford. I have gotten more and more broke as the months went on and now I think I’m about to hit rock bottom. I absolutely have no way of paying rent. I have legit $2 in my bank account and I owe over $1000 in rent and not to mention a million other bills I still owe. My apartment complex said in the email that they will be filing shit with court around mid September. They cut hours at my job so my paychecks have been even shittier. I have applied to a second job but I’m still waiting on my start date. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve made a promise to myself to commit suicide if I receive an eviction notice. I’ve been battling depression/mental illnesses for so long. It’s consumed so much of my life and caused me to make so many bad decisions. I know this is all my fault. I know it’s my fault my family doesn’t want anything to do with me. I know it’s my fault that I barely have any friends. I know it’s my fault that my ex abused me. I know it’s my fault for being so broke. I know it’s my fault. I know everything is my fault. I just don’t know why I’m so fucked in the head. I don’t know why I can’t just do the right thing. I don’t know why I can’t just do good and be stable. I don’t know why I’m such a fucking waste of space but I am. It’s like I’ve been cursed. I’ve attempted suicide many times in many different ways. Overdosing, cutting, jumping, etc but it’s like something keeps holding me back. I know I know I should take that as a sign to keep going but honestly I think my time is very soon. I’ve always thought the way I would die is by suicide and it’s going to come soon. I honestly don’t know why I’m even posting this because there’s no changing my mind. I guess I just wanted someone to listen. Even the suicide hotline was a waste of time.",

I’ve never been able to make friends or interact with others like a normal person. I’m so awkward and strange and boring. Everyone walks away. It’s been like this since I first stepped foot into a preschool. I was bullied and ignored by actual diaper-wearing toddlers. Then it progressed to elementary school and beyond to the point where I never talked to anyone but my singular fake friend at the time because anything I said would always be ignored. I was always viewed as inferior to my peers. Nobody wanted to be around me. I had a few fake friendships every now and then, but they’d drop me after about a month or so. Constantly reminding me that I’m nobody’s first choice. Never had a family that understood me. They never even tried. They don’t support me or try to help me through my mental illness. They don’t support me in anything in general. Why do people even have children if they aren’t going to be there for them ever? Not sure what else to say. Just screaming into the void again. I was a worthless kid and turned into a worthless, talentless, jobless adult who can’t function in any social situation. I just don’t belong here. Or anywhere.",

    "Angry I just found out about propranolol. I just started propranolol today, 10mg, and it feels like MAGIC, after years of being on SSRIs/meditation/relaxation/CBT/ACT/etc. My heart rate moderated, my intense anxiety body sensations like chills, tremors, went away. I estimate now that 90% of my severe work anxiety was caused by fear to adrenaline-triggered body sensations, and only 10% was triggered by my thoughts. I feel I finally have a fighting chance. CBT works better. Breathing works better. SSRIs keep doing their thing. I almost took benzos out of desperation….maybe I don’t need them. It is almost impossible to beat adrenaline when it’s working incorrectly and overwhelmingly. Propranolol is massively helping. It cuts the mind &gt; body &gt; mind vicious cycle, and allows me to do the mental work. It is insulting and enraging that this beta blocker is not prescribed more to eligible patients. A lot of suffering can be avoided. “Only” reducing the physical symptoms can be a massive win. I cannot understand how doctors don’t get that breaking the feedback loop between mind and body CAN allow the patient to better tackle the root cause of their anxiety. If you’re in the fence, my advice is take the propranolol. Try it on a low dose. Consult your doctor if needed. It’s safe, and might also give you a fighting chance against the monster of chronic anxiety. Edit: thank your /r/Anxiety community because I found out about propranolol because of you.",

    "medication changed my life. Hi guys, I’ve been on generic Lexapro (escitalopram) for roughly 10 months and I just wanted to share that (the right) medication can make all the difference. I went from spending all my energy worrying about anything and everything to… enjoying life. I’m not sure when it all changed but I think about 3 months into the medication. I used to be low on energy 24/7 because I was using it up on being anxious and on edge all the time. I couldn’t feel comfortable in my own home because I was scared of inconveniencing my roommate. 10 months later I can’t even imagine living like that anymore. it’s crazy that THIS is how it’s supposed to feel instead of being on edge from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep. because it was all I knew I thought it was normal. hell I doubted I even had GAD UNTIL I felt what it was like to live free of it. it has been a great journey. I picked up new hobbies, made new friends and in general feel way more secure and at peace. I started sleeping enough, eating well and even started going to the gym. medication made this possible by giving me the energy to do so. words can’t describe how much difference this medication has made in my life. I wake up every day and look forward to the day, talking to people, trying new things and just… living. the first few weeks of any medication will be rough. but once you find what works, it’s so worth it.",

    "You will get better!. Hey everyone, just wanted to take a minute to write on here to just to you to have hope and that things will get better. I know if you’re suffering with any kind of anxiety, you’ll be sick and tired of hearing this, I was the same but it’s true. A little about me, around a year and a half ago I was your standard 25 year old (M) I enjoyed going to the gym, hanging out with friends any chance I got, I worked full time and didn’t have a care in the world. Then basically overnight my world turned upside down. I had a panic attack whilst at home, nothing caused it and I’d never had one before so I didn’t have any idea what was happening to me and I freaked. I went from being me to not being able to leave the house for 5months, off work for 8 months and not being able to see friends and family for the longest of time. I would lie in bed for hours with this impending feeling of dread. However 1.5 years one I can happily say things are much better, I’m back at work full time, I’m able to see friends again. Managed to get to my best friends wedding and I’m able to do things that a year and a half ago were impossible! I’ll list a few things below that I wish people would have told me when I was going through it and even if just one of you can relate and feels a bit better after reading this, then I’ll know my suffering was worth it so that I can help others. - Doctors can only do so much but they know what they’re talking about even when it seems like they don’t. The amount of times l left the doctors feeling frustrated that they’d not answered anything and I was still just at perplexed as before was ridiculous. Which takes me to point 2. - Anxiety makes no sense. It’s almost impossible to rationalise something so irrational. Any symptom you can think of, anxiety can cause. To this day I still don’t understand how anxiety can cause chest pains, aches or anything but that’s okay. - No anxiety is the same, just like no 2 people are the same. There was countless times when people who suffered with anxiety were telling me how they coped with it and because that wasn’t working, I was adamant I didn’t have anxiety and there was something else wrong with me which wasn’t the case. Just because something works for one person doesn’t mean it’ll work for you, it’s all about finding out which technique works for yourself. For example, breathing techniques never really worked for me. - Medication. Extending on from my last point a little more, each person is different in which medication works for them. I tried 3 different types of medication before finding the one that was right for me. I see a lot of people on here use propranolol which works for them (which I’m happy for them about!) but that never worked for me, and that’s okay! - Counselling. It works! Don’t be embarrassed to get help and don’t let your pride/ego get in the way of getting better. I used to be the same, thought counselling was for crazy people but I couldn’t have been more wrong (as long as you get a good counsellor). They help in ways that doctors can’t. They help break down all the symptoms you’re feeling and can show you what causes them which helps put your mind at ease and sometimes it’s nice to just be able to unload all your feelings to someone. - How tiring and boring anxiety is. No one ever mentions how exhausting it is having your body on fight or flight mode all time and how boring life becomes when you’re stuck inside all day not being able to leave. Some days, you’re so exhausted by it that it’s easier to let the anxiety win and that’s okay. As long as the next day you get back up and you challenge it again. - Timeline. Just like in life, every person is on a different timeline. Some people can bounce back quicker than others and some take a little longer. I know it’s frustrating and I know it’s tiring but trust the process! - You are not alone. Anxiety is extremely isolating and at times it feels like you’re the one person in the world that it’s happening to. But there is people out there who are going through the same and as horrible as it sounds, I took comfort in reading through these threads and knowing I wasn’t the only one suffering. - My last point and the most important one. YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE. Anxiety fucking sucks and it feels like you are letting everyone down but that’s not the case. The mind is so incredibly complex and it’s just about training your mind again to think a certain way. The only thing everyone close to you cares about is you getting better and you will! You will always be the last one to notice how much better you’re getting. Apologies for this going on a bit, I didn’t mean for it to drag on but you can do this! I’m living proof that things get better and even in the darkest days, try not to lose hope and trust the process. It’s going to take time, just keep taking loads of little steps and you’ll get there. I have faith in you and I know you can do it! Love you all ❤️",

    "I went to the doctor for the first time in 14 years yesterday. This was HUGE for me.. Small backstory - I’m 41 and haven’t been to the doctor in 14 years. My anxiety and panic is almost completely about my health. Think hypochondriac but terrified to go to the doctor. I also haven’t taken medicine in 14 years - not even Tylenol, supplements, nothing. Yesterday I went for the first time. I asked her to take my BP twice. Once when I first got there and once when I was leaving. My BP going in was 168/90 and leaving it was 120 something /84. It just goes to show that my anxiety is almost always anticipatory but this woman was amazing. She’s a DPC if you know what that is. So no long waits, 24/7 access (if needed) and there’s a monthly fee to be a patient. But it’s so worth it. For anyone who struggles the way I do with health anxiety, PLEASE look into a DPC in your area. They’re everywhere. For the first time in a VERY long time, I felt seen and heard. I wasn’t made to feel like I was weird for my fears. I was asked questions and she truly listened. Now, the next hurdle is getting labs done, a mammogram and going to an ENT. But yesterday made me feel like I could conquer those things, as has this forum. I posted here a little while ago saying I’d update when I went and here I am. This was so hard, but so worth finding someone who won’t just throw pills at me for every little thing and instead wants to make sure I’m comfortable with my plan of treatment. For reference: I do go to a therapist for my anxiety. I’ve just not been to a primary care or even emergency doctor in 14 years.",

    "I wanted coffee body scrub, instead I received panic attack symptoms for 10 hours. I was in a TK Max store today looking for a coffee body scrub. Upon walking in a woman brushed by me in a rush to answer her phone and left the store. I excused her, understanding the desire not to take a phone call in such a public space. I instantly forgot about the exchange and started my pursuit of a coffee scrub. I was immediately overwhelmed and overstimulated the second I looked at the shelves, stacked 5 high and over 5 meters long. The more I looked for the scrub, the harder it was to find one. Everything was colour-coded and bright, and hard to decipher. Finally, after reading the back of eight products and over 10 minutes later, I decided on a sugar scrub (no coffee scrub was available it seemed). Then off I went, deeper into the aisles to peruse everything in the store; it's what I like to do when I go to TK Max, scour every aisle until I find something interesting. I always start at the front of the store, where the beauty products are, and continue down each aisle until I move on to the clothing. Off I went, in my own world, questioning over and over again if I had chosen the correct product while browsing everything else on offer (my brain is one of those overthinking ones that doesn't shut up). With 2 products in hand, I ventured away from the wall and then I heard it, a voice nearby. Unaware someone was close to me, I turned, searching for someone in conversation. I briefly saw a woman standing alone, out of the corner of my eye. After glimpsing her alone, I figured I must have imagined the voice, but I heard a mumble again. I dismissed the noise knowing there was only one person near me. After weighing up the advantages of each product, I discarded one and turned to the jewellery area, when I heard it again. Determined to work out if I was slowly losing my mind, I turned again, focusing on the only individual within proximity. She made eye contact quickly and spoke louder, this time I could hear her. \"Ohhh the stalker is staring at me, stop stalking me!\" she said. Stunned, I looked away, wondering who was stalking this woman, there was only herself and me in the beauty area. I instantly became worried, my anxiety peaking, I thought she might not be all there in the head, and wandered off to the jewellery section. As I looked at the jewellery, I couldn't stop thinking about the woman, and who was \"stalking\" her. It was then I realised, that the woman who brushed by me upon my entry was the exact woman who was being stalked. As someone overly aware of their surroundings, this late realisation startled me. And then it occurred, I processed what the woman had said. She thought I was stalking her! I instantly felt sick, I wanted to go and fight her and argue that I was the last person on Earth to stalk someone, that it's not who I am, that I'm a good person, and why the fuck, would I want to stalk some older weird woman, but I didn’t. I was scared and wanted to leave, but I wanted to prove I wasn’t a stalker more than my desire to leave, and so I stayed shopping for the next hour, bouncing between disassociating and racing thoughts. More than 10 hours have passed and I am still rattled. I do not understand the emotions that I am experiencing, it feels almost like heartache, for someone to judge and attack me so quickly. My tongue is in my throat, my cheeks are burning with tears, and my anxiety wants my head over a toilet bowl.",
    "What does your anxiety feel like?. Mine feels like chest pressure, heart racing, sweating, dizziness or when it goes into panic attack I get stroke like symptoms. Not fun.",
    "My anxiety guide - How I beat my anxiety. It's 4 am here and I couldn't sleep so I decided to make this post. Hope this helps some of you. First of all I've suffered from anxiety (general anxiety, social anxiety, health anxiety) severely for more than 1 year non-stop. I've got all the physical effects (dizziness, air hunger, shortness of breath, hearth palpitations, loss of appetite and many others that I can't remember right now.) I couldn't even leave my room at that period of my life. It was terrible. I literally wasted that period of time thanks to anxiety. Over the time, I overcame my anxiety without using an anti depressant because I was too afraid to use an anti depressant even tho my doctor prescribed me one. When I tell my friends I've suffered from severe anxiety none of them believes me. They think I'm the last person to have anxiety and I'm too social. Lmao. Here's few things that will help A LOT with your anxiety in a few weeks. **1- Start exercising. Lift weight if possible. I can't tell you how much it helped me.** **2- Do one thing that you don't want to do, every day. It may be going outside or making a phone call or eating something you are afraid to eat (health anxiety). Just do it. Go against your fears. That's incredibly effective against anxiety. Basically you're leaving your comfort zone. You are going out with your friends but you are too scared? Then do it scared. Don't let anxiety stealing your life.** **Going towards your anxiety is where the grow begins.** 3- Stop consuming too much social media. Scrolling non stop messes with our brain. Please limit your screen time. 4- Meditate 10 mins a day. Maybe 5 mins in mornings and 5 mins at nights. 5- Set aside 20-30 minutes for studying. It can be learning a new language, studying a new subject, history, space etc. It's up to you. Idk why but studying something release happy chemicals in the brain. 6- Drink enough water. Those things literally saved me. Especially regular exercising is a miracle. I can't recommend it enough. Step 2 is the second most important thing as well. P.s. I know all the things I mentioned above are so hard to do for an anxious person but you have to do. You have to be stubborn to overcome anxiety. Anxiety only exists if you let it.",
    "Does anyone else get literal panic bathroom anxiety needing to poop. Anytime I get anxious my entire body just wants to evacuate every single food and fluid, and my heart rate accelerates. It's like a less servere panic attack, and happens whether I eat or not so I don't think it's IBS. I've been misdiagnosed and even took hydrazine to attempt to help and it failed. It is a weird hyper specific problem and I don't even know if medication exists for it. It literally ruins my fucking life, especially in school kids are evil you CANNOT use a bathroom in school so id spend literal hours in a torturous crowning anxiety circle. Plus its genuinely so embarrassing as well to have to run off use public bathrooms then smell like garbage for the rest of the time.",

    "It can get better, but it’s going to suck for a while (31m). Last year I developed a panic disorder out of nowhere, as well as a digestive disorder, and it basically ruined my life. - 3+ panic attacks a day - couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, couldn’t drive, could barely work (even remotely) - nothing but diarrhea - constant sense of impending doom - looping intrusive thoughts about how everything was falling apart - episodes where I would just sob uncontrollably - I was living alone at the time and suddenly being alone was when my mind would attack me the most - sheer exhaustion. Couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t enjoy things, couldn’t think. I sold my house, moved home with my parents (grateful I had the option), and tried to start again. - my psychiatrist and I scrapped my medication regimen because it did nothing for this. - I’m now on a cocktail of low doses of 4 meds because my body doesn’t metabolize medications well. A full dose of 1 antidepressant can make me sick. - buspar, lamictal, pristiq, adderall. Between the four, the panic is quieted, and the lethargy / depression / brain fog is way less intense. - obviously everyone is different with medications, but buspar alone really changed my life. I wept when I started taking it and my intrusive/obsessive/looping thoughts just went… quiet. - after I got the meds figured out I started therapy weekly. My therapist acknowledged that it’s hard to do the work when you’re already in crisis. It’s been hugely beneficial for me to talk every week and I’m grateful I have access to it. - I journaled every single day. Sometimes about the anxiety, but often about the good things that happened that day, or about hope, or about my goals. - I started working out 3x a week because I quickly realized how much less anxious i am after. When I have a bad day nowadays, I’ll go out of my way to exercise because I know it helps. - I leaned on family and friends for the first time ever. I hate feeling like I “owe” people, so I typically didn’t ask for much, but they really, really showed up in a life-saving way. - I’ve changed my priorities these days. Is it improving my life? Does it bring me joy? Does it mess with my stability? - I listen to my body now. When I feel extra anxious, i run through a checklist (HALT) and address any issues - I no longer fight / avoid the anxiety, because it only gives it more control over me. If it happens it happens, and I’ll sit through it out of sheer stubbornness. It’s helped give me some agency back. It took an entire year of this to get back to a stable place (June 23 - June 24) and it’s a constant work in progress / upkeep. I hope literally any of this helped - there’s only so much I can put in one post, but please know that it CAN really get better, it just might suck a WHOLE lot for a while first. I’ll try to answer any questions when I can. Keep going!",

    "Health anxiety is evil. I developed constant anxiety about 4 ish weeks ago after having a panic attack that felt like a heart attack. It comes and goes but it feels like theres no escape, anything that sets off a small amount of anxiety will spiral into being worried about the anxiety symptoms and feeling like a life threatening illness. It keeps evolving too, every panic attack feels the same but completely different, this time i didnt have chest pain but felt super faint and dizzy like i was about to drop dead. The only way i can tell the difference is if im able to calm myself down or distract myself and the symptoms get better, because im guessing a life threatening illness wont just come and go depending on my mood lol. Its ruining my life, my sleep is terrible, im constantly out of energy, i can barely focus on anything (not that i could anyway tbh). I cant make any long term progress in my life when im barely able to live day by day",

I know how to explain it, like even though before the pandemic I still had a lot issues, i could still handle it without being overwhelmed there is still a bit of zest/will to live but ever since the start of the pandemic lockdown and ever since the start of 2020 my mental health is way worse than it has before, and it feels like I'm in a different world after the pandemic I noticed that even the most mentally strong people also said this that they are becoming more pessimistic after the pandemic too Does anyone relate to this or am I the only one?",

    "65 y/o MIL is refusing to go to the ER due to agoraphobia; please help.. Long story short, last Thursday she almost died via choking. By the time I got to her she'd been unconscious for an unknown period of time and was fully blue, but I performed CPR and managed to get her breathing and conscious again. The paramedics insisted that she should really, *really* go to the hospital to get checked out, but she refused. Since then she's been experiencing severe chest pain causing her to cry out in pain w/ basic activity, and she's now developed a cough (We're pretty sure this is an infection, cuz her husband and I are both also sick), which is only making things worse. She's restraining her coughs cuz they hurt so badly, and overall it seems really, really obvious that she needs medical attention, but she won't let me or my wife take her to the hospital. She gave us a whole gamut of excuses, but when I eventually pressed her directly as to why she was so resistant even though this was obviously so serious, she admitted she was anxious and didn't want to go outside. I'm going to rip my hair out from worry at this point. I don't want to undermine her anxiety, but apparently she's even having some trouble breathing. I don't want this to escalate further to the point she gets seriously hurt, sick, or worse. My wife even called off work today cuz her mom briefly agreed to go if she stayed home to drive her, but then immediately after she started waffling again. Does anyone please have any advice on how to work through this? I'm scared out of my mind but she's being extremely stubborn and idk what to do.",

    "I finally scheduled with my OBGYN. I'm 7 months pregnant, and I am severely anxious about making doctor's appointments. I've always had a really hard time doing it. My first one was a breeze because I got assigned to a coordinator who set me up with an OB over the phone and made it for me, and the rest after that were pretty easy because they would just reschedule me when I came in. In late July they scheduled me for an appointment in early August, but I forgot about it completely, which is already out of character for me. I didn't know what to do after that. I got so freaked out about forgetting it that I was too scared to call and ask to reschedule, and every time I tried to pick up the phone to do it I just couldn't bring myself to. This went on for over a month, it's bad I know. Yesterday I finally worked up the courage to do it. I don't know what I was expecting them to say to me, but they were really nice and didn't even bring up me missing the appointment. I had myself so worked up over this, and the phone call only took about 5 minutes, and it was super easy. I now have an appointment on Monday! If anybody is in the same boat, take it from me, it feels like a huge weight came off my shoulders. It was truly not as bad as it seemed. You can do it!",

    "I just had the worst panic attack of my life. i have experienced mild panic attacks for years. They are usually quick but recently I have had one that physically made me ill, i screamed until my throat hurt, and i have been fidgeting and scratching at my skin. i dropped my boyfriend off at the airport as he is going to long island to visit family. he is driving back over 14 hours a few days from now and i can't escape a feeling of dread. the worst dread i have ever experienced. i think he is going to die, i think he will die in a wreck, i am tracking his flight like a maniac and i am looking up the age of the plane and the model. the model is boeing and i KNOW planes are safe but i can't help but feel like he's already dead. i was driving back and just pulled over my car and screamed. i cried. (still am) i have never in my life experienced anything like this. i'm exhausted, i'm scared, i've given up. i am afraid of what my mind is doing to me. help. edit: i am genuinely terrified. i feel like i am going to pass out. i am in college and have an exam tomorrow and i just can't focus. everything i do reminds me of him. in my mind he is already dead. he is on the plane right now. i've vomited and i am cold and clammy. i am sitting in my car and i just can't do anything but reach out to strangers for help. my family won't understand. i have talked to a friend me and my boyfriend share in hysterics and he just told me \"it's gonna be fine\" and i just don't believe him. he's lying to me. 2nd edit (12 hours after original post): I wanted to clarify that I am doing so much better now thanks to (mostly) everyones advice! I am working out how to get REAL medical help, but I am extremely appreciative of the advice I received mid-crisis. Anxiety is irrational and I know it may have seemed like I could control my thoughts (since I was aware of their irrationality) but I promise to anyone who thinks I could just \"stop worrying\" or that my boyfriend is the only person my life revolves around and that's what caused this, I couldn't control how I felt in that moment and I have definitely never had a panic attack this severe regarding my boyfriend's whereabouts.

My stomach is sensitive (although I don’t usually have episodes when I’m not anxious). When I get into a situation without a toilet, sometimes I start spiraling. “What if I ate something funky and my stomach acts up?” “There’s no washroom for another hour, you’re screwed”. “The panic is going to happen again like always”.

    "Hypochondria is ruining my life.. I would like to share my story with you all here because I feel like this is eating me up alive. My brother passed away at the age of 38 due to colon cancer in 2021. Since that traumatic experience, losing him made me realize that not only has grief stricken my heart, but severe anxiety has also developed in my head. I am 32 now and I am healthy. However, any time there is an issue with my body or I feel even a slight pain or discomfort i automatically think it’s the worst. For example, I woke up one day with a Charlie horse, and the cramp wouldn’t go away. I went to the doctor convinced that I had a deep vein thrombosis. It ended up being a cramp. Another instance of this is when I found a lump on my boob, and I automatically thought it was breast cancer. It turned out to be a pimple after all. Another example of this is when I went to the ER to get inspected for my leg cramp, they also told me that they would take a blood and urine sample to rule out anything else - in that moment, I started crying uncontrollably in the waiting room telling the nurse that they will for sure find renal failure and cancer with my results. I literally couldn’t breathe and couldn’t talk. The nurse had to calm me down. My lab tests however came back normal with elevated white blood cells, and it had to with my stress. I cried of relief when the doctor said all was normal. To my embarrassment, I think they thought I was severely dramatic. Another thing which is TMI, I also check my poop every time I take a dump - and when I mean check, I mean I light my phone up on the toilet bowl and inspect if the poop is any abnormal coloration to make sure if abnormality is happening. Another instance of this is thinking I will also die in my 30s, because my brother was misdiagnosed with hemorrhoids when it was literally colon cancer. He also didn’t have any symptoms for years. That also makes me not trust the doctors for the truth or that they aren’t looking “as deeply” into it. As you guys can see, I spiral out of control and I don’t know how to stop these intrusive thoughts that I’m on the verge of death everytime I am concerned about my health. This is ruining my life, I’m constantly thinking about it. Truly this didn’t develop until 2023, two years after my brothers death. Could it be PTSD? Does anyone else feel this way?",
    "my school bullying makes me not eat at all. hello, i moved to finland from Ukraine 2 years ago and im currently in school, however my spoken finnish is horrible and i am bullied heavily by the boys in my classes, more often than not spat at and i was called a whore and had my hair pulled many times. this is making me not want to attend school anymore and i have began to not eat at all because im so anxious, leading me to become very weak and i throw up very easily now when i go near my school without shaking or breathijg fast and i think about throwing myself in front of the train everyday and i genuinely think im very close to doing so soon. i cant fucking take it",
    "I (25f) had my first panic attack yesterday. My life has been very stressful lately and everything just came to a head yesterday I guess. I couldn’t breathe, my head felt like I was either spinning or in a fog (or both), my legs, fingers, and face were all numb and tingling. As soon as the thought “I’m having a heart attack” entered my brain I was pretty confident that it was a panic attack. I then started trying any coping mechanisms I could possibly think of- breathing exercises, changing scenery, focusing on different things, taking a walk. What struck me was how the coping mechanisms not working made me even more convinced that what was happening to me was physical. As I ran through the list, the voice inside of my head that was saying, “I told you that you were having a heart attack” grew louder, panicking me more. I’ve never had one this intense before. Usually, my panic attacks look like crying, shaking, and the inability to get warm. The “death dry run” I experienced yesterday was a billion times worse… I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy. I’m booking a psychologist appointment ASAP. Just wanted to write my thoughts down.",

    "Health Anxiety is Ruining my Life. Ugh, I’m so frustrated even writing this.. as many of us deal with anxiety in general, it just feels like it’s a never ending cycle. I got on Zoloft 2 months ago and I haven’t felt so good in so long.. but now I feel like I’m going back down hill. If it’s not one thing, it’s another. I can’t stop hyper focussing on any “symptoms” I may have. I’m just so frustrated and I don’t get why I cannot get a break. Any advice is welcomed.. Edit: Just for some more insight, I do have OCD/GAD.. I have been in therapy for 4+ years, I also did group therapy.. I mean ya girl is trying everything over here.. health anxiety start around COVID and just has progressively gotten worse. I cry daily because I just want my life back.. I want to be happy.. I appreciate all the support as I know you guys are here doing the same thing I am, looking for answers and trying to just be happy. So, thank you.. 🫶🏽",
    "What are some short term coping skills you use?. So long term ones (ex. regular exercise, eliminating caffeine) I’m already familiar with, so I need some “in the moment” things. If I can, I’ll take a hot shower, play a mindless phone game, or breathing exercises. Sometimes those things don’t work and it’ll get my anxiety going even more. I’ve been so anxious lately that it’s making me physically ill which makes some of the long term coping skills difficult to do. That being said, what’s something in the moment you do? Is there a particular way you have to do it? What about it helps you calm down?",
    "The worst it’s ever been. 29F. I’ve had anxiety/depression my whole life. In college it reached an all time high to where it was hard to function, and I’ve always been high functioning, so I sought help and medicine and improved. I was improved for several years with the help of just sertraline. Then I took myself off the sertraline and was fine for years. But then I had a health episode that couldn’t be explained in March 2024. I had started back taking a low dose of sertraline I had left over due to having an upcoming trip that was making me very anxious. It was still in date, so I thought why not. My PCP wasn’t aware, and still isn’t. I was only on it maybe 4 days before this trip, but the day before the trip and then through the trip and when I got home, I was having continuous palpitations. I mean constantly. I stopped the sertraline and tried to get in with my cardiologist, but before the appt could get here I started feeling bad- on top of the palpitations I experienced chest pain, right arm and leg numbness/pain, dizziness, and heat all through my body. I went to the ER, and they couldn’t find anything. The palpitations went from continuous to frequent, but not as extreme. The cardiologist thoroughly checked me out over the next two months, and couldn’t find anything besides venous insufficiency, and told me it was probably bad blood flow from my legs to my heart. Since then, I’ve done everything he said to- lost weight, more active, compression socks DAILY, raised feet when sitting- but it’s not improved. So since March I’ve been racked with extreme anxiety and paranoia of every sensation of my body. And on top of that, my family has been facing extreme stress on both sides, due to severe issues, which is also affecting me. And my husband and I have been struggling with infertility for over 4 years and I can’t even take my medicines because I already feel bad and don’t think I can handle adding to it with the other hormones to try to conceive right now. So I feel stress from him (he’s unaware and hasn’t done anything to cause it) and his family and my own desire to be a mom. Also, despite all this stress, my heart rate has been lower than ever, occasionally getting down in the 40s, which terrifies me, because the cardiologist can’t figure out why. My body is in fight or flight mode and I sincerely cannot get it to be relaxed. I can’t function. My chest is hurting regularly, I’m facing frequent dizzy spells for the first time in my life, along with some other things. My PCP started me on sertraline again but it caused the palpitations to be more frequent, and left arm cramps. Then she tried duloxentine (cymbalta) but it made me numbed over and like I couldn’t breathe. Then buspirone, but after two weeks it made my chest area hurt and my face hot and flushed so the pharmacy told me to stop taking it. I’ve started seeing a psychiatrist, but haven’t got far into it yet. It’s just really bad. I can’t even be alone- at work or at home- without being scared. I’m trying not to look at my apple watch unless it gives high or low notifications because I know it’s stress inducing to sit and monitor it like I do. I’m trying not to over analyze every feeling in my body. I’m trying to just live and enjoy living. But it’s gotten so hard. I’m not suicidal, but definitely depressed to some extent. I’m only 29, and shouldn’t have these debilitating thoughts. If anyone has read this far, thank you just for reading, and I hope you overcome the struggles you may not talk about. I just needed to get it out.",

Today I took painkillers and got all paranoid as I wasn't sure if I took a does previously unintentionally giving myself an OD. I have had more caffeine then I usually have which I know is a trigger. Of course me worrying gave me my largest panic attack of years and it's been going up and down for around 3 hours, this tide in with the fact I thought I was overdosing convinced me I was dying.

    "An analogy for how SSRI's effect my brain. I hope this may help you.. As someone who has struggled with anxiety my entire life and has been on SSRI's (Effexor) for the past 20 years, I wanted to share how SSRI's make me feel. I hope that this may be helpful for some of you. \\*Note - this is not a perfect analogy, the human brain is really complex, but I find it to be mostly accurate (atleast for me). ---- **Imagine each your emotions are individual songs on a vinyl record.** i.e Song 1- Anxiety Song 2 - Happy Song 3 - Joyful Song 4 - Excited Song 5 - Depressed etc. **Now imagine the Volume knob (from 0-10) is how loud you are hearing that song be played. (I.e the volume represents the INTENSITY that you feel each of these emotions at.)** When you take anxiety meds, it turns down the volume of the song thats being played (i.e, the intensity that you experience the emotion). HERES THE IMPORTANT PART- **SSRI's do not change the song that is being played, just the volume. Also it turns down the volume for ALL SONGS on the vinyl record.** You can’t pick and choose which song gets played at which volume So SSRI's can make you feel less anxious, but it also makes you feel less happy and excited. **THE ISSUE ISN’T THAT THE ANXIETY SONG IS BEING PLAYED AT THE HIGH VOLUME. BUT THAT YOUR BRAIN IS STUCK SPENDING MOST OF ITS TIME LISTENING TO THE ANXIETY SONG.** SSRI's can only change the volume of the songs, it can’t change the track that is being played. Deep down there are things going on in our lives that make us spend most of our time listening to the anxiety song. And unless those things get addressed, we just keep on playing the same track. I've come to this realization the other day when I could not remember the last time that I felt happy or excited.",

    "Health Anxiety Advice Please. Hi all, I'm a 20 year old female with no known health issues. For some back story, l've had anxiety almost my whole life but only ever in social aspects until the last month or so due to recent events. Since then, l've been sent into an absolute spiral and it's ruining my life. My anxiety has never really been on the physical side. I might've gotten the occasional stomach churn, racing heart, etc. But nothing compared to what is happening to me right now. The following symptoms are what have thrown me neck deep in health anxiety. - ﻿Ice pick headaches - ﻿Tension headaches (including behind both eyes) - ﻿Crawling/ tingling sensation on my scalp - ﻿Blurry vision - ﻿Sensitivity to light - ﻿Eye twitches - ﻿Dizziness - ﻿Severe brain fog - ﻿Disassociation/ derealization - ﻿Sharp ear and jaw pain both sides - ﻿Neck pain - ﻿Throat tightness - ﻿Sharp shooting armpit pain - ﻿Chest tightness - ﻿Heart palpitations - ﻿Chest pain both sides which can increase when taking deep breaths - ﻿Back pain - ﻿Sharp abdominal pain - ﻿Dull abdominal pain - ﻿Joint pain in fingers and toes - ﻿Muscle pain in arms and legs - ﻿Numbness/ weakness in arms and legs - ﻿Hot flashes - That's all I can list off the top of my head, there is most likely more but anyway - when these first started to appear, I made the mistake of googling what they might relate to which has now triggered a horrible cycle for me. In the past month I have diagnosed myself with cancer, aneurysms, pulmonary embolism, toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, meningitis. The list is never ending. This resulted in many panic attacks to which I would then drive myself to the ER, where I've now been told by many of the doctors there that it is most likely a result of my anxiety and iron deficiency anemia. Only problem is, I sometimes struggle to believe that due to the fact that I’ve had anxiety and low iron for years and have never once suffered the above symptoms before, until now? It doesn’t seem to add up. These are all the tests I’ve had done during my time spent in the ER, all of which came back fine. -blood pressure -countless blood tests -countless ECG -x2 internal ultrasound -transabdominal ultrasound -x2 pelvic ultrasound -brain ct scan -chest ct scan -x2 chest xray Since then I’ve also paid a visit to the optometrist who confirmed my eyes are healthy. I’ve also had an iron infusion about a week and a half ago and I’ve just started taking magnesium and ashwagandha to hopefully notice some improvements. I guess I just want people’s opinions. Do I stop here? Should I push for more tests? Is it most likely my anxiety? Or do you guys think I’m suffering from something more serious? I’m seriously so lost at the moment and I feel like I need the opinions of people who don’t know me personally. Some days I have the strength to reassure myself I’m probably fine but most days my anxiety gets the best of me and I convince myself that I’m dying and the doctors have missed something. Any advise is greatly appreciated.",

    "28F. My extended family knows my cousin (9 years older than me) sexually abused me for 12 years. Yesterday most of them attended his wedding.. I want someone to be angry with me. I want everyone to be angry with me. I’m a 28F and left my hometown two years ago where he sexually abused me for 12 years. I was 13 years old when he began grooming me and he was 22 years old. He began sexually abusing me when I turned 14. There are thousands of instances of abuse he perpetrated that I’m working through in my own therapy. He forced me to do many things and promised to take me away. He claimed he did what he did because he could “see a future with me” at 13 years old. I confronted him numerous times, suicidal, raging, confused, but unable to leave as I grew older and realized how fucked up it all was. He molded me into a human I hated, and I was only that way in context with him. I was a PhD student at the time I left and got matched for a mandatory internship on the other side of the country. I was going to leave. However, right before I did, my abuser got me one more time. He recorded me secretly (in a state where it is unfortunately legal) begging for sex and he sent it to his coworkers. It left me suicidal for weeks, I lost upwards of 15-17lbs because I couldn’t eat, and I kept having nightmares of the abuse. None of the people in his workplace or friends know what he did (of course, and every time I DID tell someone he was my abuser, he made me feel like absolute shit). A big irony is that he’s a charge nurse of a trauma unit of a psychiatric hospital and well-loved. I work in the field of mental health and decided I could never work in that city again, not just because I hate it there but because the professional mental health community is small and it’s probably known who I am, what I said in that recording, but not my relation to him (he forced me to hide that and hid it himself). Last year, with the loving support of my partner (the greatest corrective experience a person could ask for), I made the decision to tell my family. My cousins and I grew up close (which contributed to how my abuser got his hands on me) and my aunts and uncles claim to see me like a daughter. He made me treat them like shit during the abuse because he hated them himself (e.g., threatened me if I smiled in photos with them, threatened me if I spent time alone with them, threatened me if he caught I was happy in any way with them and he was not present). I am financially independent (so no one has control over me in any way), live on the other side of the country, and have had some positive experiences telling a few of my cousins so far and wanted it to be known so I could set boundaries if I ever returned home. As you could probably imagine, one of my aunts victim blamed me to my face. The others haven’t spoken to me or pretend they never heard me say what. The only thing they promised is that they would separate us if I ever visited home. I’ve been undergoing cognitive processing therapy to really work through the years of abuse. It’s been helping some, and I’ve even managed to block or unfriend family members who have historically hurt me. Some I’ve kept around on social media because I still want some semblance of family and am working through the grief of not ever really achieving that. In the process of my working through, I neglected to block one. That’s how I found out about the wedding and saw all of their bright happy faces smiling with the man who sexually abused me and took my childhood and adolescence away. I’m feeling angry, hurt, unheard, worthless, every form of rage. I just imagine stabbing his head over and over and over. I screamed and hyperventilated for a few minutes while my partner held me through the trauma response after I saw it. My throat is raw because my body and brain felt like I was screaming and fighting for my life just seeing a picture of them. The betrayal hurt more than I thought it would. My extended family chose their public image over me. Knowing full well what he did. I wanted to comment that he’s my abuser. Post everywhere what he did. But there’s no evidence (he literally burned it). I’ve tried reporting him two years to the police and to the state’s Board of Nursing because he has access to children, but there’s no outlet that allows an investigation. There are no protections for me, and most of my family back home will stand smiling with him and not to protect me. I guess I just want someone to be angry for and alongside me. I want my childhood and adolescence back. I want him to pay, but I know he likely never will. I want him to never have joy. His new wife will never know what he did because he has control of the narrative about me since I left. He has control again. And they give him support so freely. This happens to thousands if not millions of victims. I’m another number on that list. Please, be angry for me. Please. I need people to be angry for me because I’m so fucking tired. ———UPDATE Thank you all for being angry for me. I went to my therapist yesterday and talked about sharing my story on my instagram, as most of my friends with whom I interact with regularly are there. Most family have been blocked and unfriended. My intention for posting it on my page would be to say goodbye to those who chose my abuser and their public image over me. So, I did. Hundreds of people saw, dozens of people reached out and shared their anger for me. I have felt more loved in the last 24 hours than I have by the people with whom I share my last name in all of my 28 years (though three of my cousins are cool and didn’t attend in solidarity with me, so kudos to them). The news of me going public with my abuse history and my extended relatives’ attendance made it to my parents. They called, and I clarified to my parents that I don’t hate them; I’m sad and angry with them because of how long the abuse went on. They did not attend the wedding (they clearly weren’t invited to begin with because they openly hate my abuser; a whole other shit show in and of itself, but I digress). The news will (hopefully) make it to my extended family who attended and support my abuser. They will victim-blame me, try to avoid responsibility, try to justify themselves, try to villainize me, and more. There’s a difference between us: I can own that I wasn’t the perfect niece or cousin. I have owned it. But that is also not justification for their inaction. It doesn’t mean they are innocent for letting the abuse slide. They knew. Not only did they do nothing, they openly supported my abuser and tried their best to hide it. Let’s not be naive here: they cannot hide their role in creating the perfect storm for abuse to go on for 12 years. To them, I say this: you are not family. You are a ghost of a family. Your values are skewed to benefit yourselves and look beautiful and perfect. Once this reaches you, I may be dead to you. But you were never worthy of seeing or being in my life to begin with.",
    "Let’s all be more thoughtful, please.. Just a gentle reminder, but can we all make it a point to be more mindful and considerate when interacting with others on this sub? I just saw someone essentially bullied off this sub, gatekept, and insulted and it was really discouraging to see. In some cases, the circumstances in which PTSD can develop are complicated and muddy, and sometimes that can bring up some uncomfortable feelings within ourselves. I just wish everyone would be more mindful that people are coming to our sub for community and help, and not to be insulted and minimized. I understand we’re all hurting, but our words have consequences. I want us to all have humility and grace for each-other, and even apologize when necessary. We should all ask ourselves before we hit post: “Is what I’m saying constructive, or destructive to the situation?” If you have concerns for bad-faith actors, that’s what we have mods for. Otherwise you can potentially be hurting someone who is already hurting very, very badly. There’s a way to word concerns and criticisms without attacking someone. We should aim to be a safe space for all those who are dealing with PTSD and trauma, not just those we deem personally worthy. Edit here: I understand some topics may be uncomfortable for some users. Let’s remember that if you see something on this board you may find potentially triggering and upsetting, you are not obliged to respond or contribute. You can just silence the post for your own health, and there’s power in doing so. Sometimes it’s important to say “Not my circus, not my monkey.” and move on. Just my two cents.",

    "hey, people with ptsd, what's something about it that you wish writers got right?. I hope this isn't against the rules, there weren't any I see that were in direct conflict w/ this post but you never really know. I am a writer, and I am trying to write a character with PTSD.

    "Wife diagnosed with severe PTSD and disassociation. I don’t know what to do.. My (49) wife (41) was diagnosed a few years ago with severe PTSD and dissociative disorder due to severe abuse from her recently deceased father. She disassociates nightly which is often triggered by alcohol. (I have had issues with drinking and depression but I’m seeing a therapist and working through my issues.) She is abusive during these episodes and is also severely self destructive. The episodes seem to be getting deeper and more frequent. I am in a constant state of worry about what might happen to her or our little family. My job requires me to be away from home for four months at a time. I work four on two off. She started seeing a therapist but stopped and every time I bring it up she says “that’s not the answer.” Her father drank to the point of losing his mind and eventually died tragically by drowning. She has said to me recently that she’s terrified of losing her mind like her father but I can’t seem to get it through to her that her only way forward is therapy. I live in constant fear that something terrible is going to happen. I don’t want to leave my wife. I am pretty much the only guy she’s been serious with. We’ve been together 20 years. Add: My wife is from the UK, all of her family is over there which obviously complicates things even more.",

    "He set me up. He sent me out to die.. Afghanistan: my commanding officer ordered me to give up my rounds to the incoming team. Typical for rotation. I had been there 8.5 months and was headed back in a couple of weeks. I had done over 70 missions as an intelligence resource for early warning threats. I never lost a soldier and was able to provide credible intelligence to infantry commanders to keep us out of unneeded firefights. When the incoming unit came in to take over our mission my Intelligence commanding officer ordered me to give up my rounds to my counterpart. Typical standard operating procedure. However, he was still slotting me for missions. When I asked him what am I supposed to to use for ammo, he told me it was my problem. Ever since I’ve had a lot of issues with authority and questioned my own value if my own commander was willing to send me out with nothing to die. I felt set up. For years I felt that I was making the feelings up. The threat was fake and he wouldn’t have done it if I was in real danger, but I still felt worthless. Since then I’ve asked SEALS, Rangers, and other special unit members about if I felt justified in my feelings, to which they’ve all responded “Yeah man, that’s super fucked up. Don’t think that’s ok for a second what he did.” I still feel it sometimes like now though",

This has really hurt me in every aspect of my life because I suffer and suffer silently because I refuse to ever ask for help.

    "How do you politely ask someone to fuck off and give you space?. I intentionally shop at grocery stores where I know there will be a self checkout. I can’t stand in congested lines or have people staring at me. I try to do grocery pickups but sometimes I shop later at night. I shop at a store and every single time I try to choose a self checkout as far away from the worker standing around as possible. Every single fucking time they find some excuse to mosey behind me, right on my asshole or at the register next to me. I completely understand they are monitoring people, but standing just inches behind me is completely unnecessary. I usually use my cart to create space between us and stare at them so they can maybe get the message that they’re standing way too fucking close in my breathing space. I have PTSD from violence and when people get too close I go into both a panic and rage. I do *not* like when someone is standing behind me and I can’t see them. When I was walking in a worker was gathering carts and was walking very quickly behind me, matching my speed. It freaked me out (I walk fast and was trying to walk away from this person, it felt like I was being chased. I wasn’t, but I have PTSD and nothing is reasonable anymore) and I was already in a panicky mood at the store. I’ve worked retail and at a grocery store. I don’t know how I would feel if a customer told me I was too close to them. A lot of these workers are older women and frankly have no sense of physical boundary. I’m tired of crying in my car. I’m on an SSRI for anxiety but it doesn’t help with social situations. The only thing that helps is lorazepam, which I don’t like taking daily or if I don’t truly need it. However it does make me more direct with people, which is good. I’m just so tired of these workers not respecting my space. I’ll literally watch them pretend to check on something just to stand next to my register. Like there are cameras. Fuck off. Sorry but I also just needed to rant somewhere. Having PTSD is devastating. This woman unknowingly standing too close to me legit ruined my night. This shit isn’t fair. And I’m tired of feeling ready to fight someone because they walk past me or stand too close. I’m such an angry person and I hate this.",
    "Feeling like the trauma wasn't \"bad enough\". I keep circling back to the same thought patterns throughout my PTSD recovery and it's so exhausting. Would love to hear your thoughts, opinions and experiences. ATM, I'm stuck (again!) with the thought that my trauma wasn't bad at all. I know cognitively that the PTSD isn't inherent to the event itself but rather the severity of your reaction and symptoms to it. Still, as soon as I'm not feeling my absolute worst with my symptoms, I feel like I don't deserve therapy or my diagnosis. I feel like I'm pretending and being overdramatic. I start going down the spiral of comparing my trauma. And as much as I love this community, as much joy and hope it brings me, I can't help but feel terrible as soon as I compare myself. I was SA'd 3 times, but it wasn't CSA, I was 18. I was r***d, but it wasn't the stereotypical dark-alley-assault. My T suspects childhood trauma, but I grew up in a loving family. I was in an abusive relationship, but it never got physically/sexually abusive. Do you know what I mean? I just can't shake the guilt and all the feelings this time, I can't get out of it anymore.

I am not easily triggered for the most part. I gained a reputation for being a bit of a tough guy. I can handle hearing, seeing or dealing with all sorts of awful things (everything from intense violence, to infected injuries, to dementia patients) without being too bothered by it. But anything involving hurt animals... That's an entirely different thing. I'm currently shaken from reading a non-graphic post someone wrote about losing her dog. All I can think of is the sheer horror, both of her and the dog. I once got hired to do some design work on a children's book that mentioned an in-universe-fictional cat dying. Even within the story they weren't real! And I still cried uncontrollably through the 4 hours of working on that thing. It doesn't even need to be death or serious injury. I have to bring an emotional support human with me whenever I take my cat to the vet, because she is so stressed and I cannot. Pretty much nothing else gets this kind of a response from me. It's not terrible or anything, but I do wonder if I'm tye only person that's like this.",

    "Reliving the memories of my attempted murder by my ex fiance's mother.. In 2019 I got engaged to what I thought was the love of my life in Germany, I'm in another country, flew over there and had an amazing engagement on the 14th December. Then ten days later her mother poisoned me with chlorine dioxide gas in an attempt to cure my asthma, prevented me from going to the hospital and eventually I managed to get them to take me, they promised me they would tell the doctors they gave me the chemical but instead they made it look like they did to me spoke in German which I didn't understand and I was forced to watch my fiance betray me over and over again when I would try to speak they would change what I said, long story short treating me for asthma obviously wasn't working I was in pulmonary edema (drowning in my own lungs) doctors couldn't save me, they were crying, miraculously I survived. Doctors asked me to get the police involved as they thought is was on purpose to stop me from marrying the daughter, I refused as I thought that I could save my fiance from crazy family. In the end she turned on me and demanded I get rid of the evidence (got their confession to doing it on purpose) I then ended it with her. I still have flash backs of mostly the good stuff, they are very intense and I go through deep depression to the point of feeling suicidal. I had multiple psychotic breaks from the grief and now am a diagnosed bipolar (although they weren't confident on that assessment) My PTSD can come back at any moment and it's all consuming, to the point where I long for all the good times before the hospital and being in love with her so much that I get sick.

But after I got raped and the police did nothing. People posting sexual videos and photos of me online with my social media’s on it so I was getting messages from creepy people. Abused and the police did nothing. Physically hurt by bullies and the police did nothing. Someone attempted to kidnap me and…YOU GUESSED IT the police did nothing until fun fact they actually successfully kidnapped another girl. I used to trust the police. I used to care about the law. Infact I only stole one time as a kid and felt guilty for years and ended up giving what I stole away because I didn’t agree with breaking the law in any capacity. Until at 14 the videos of me were posted online by someone I know. You’d think that’s ILLEGAL. You’d think they care. But no. The fact my face wasn’t in it meant it wasn’t a big deal. And it wasn’t necessarily that person. And to track IP that costs money and time apparently. This changed me. I don’t think I’ve ever been the same. It seems ridiculous to me. What do they even do. Isn’t these things supposed to be serious? After this I went off the rails. Started stealing,drinking,doing drugs I didn’t care. The police don’t care. Until recently I did something quite bad which got reported to the police. Obviously I don’t want to get arrested and I was bricking it. Then today I found out I’ve completely gotten away with it. They didn’t do anything. They didn’t even question me or anything. Which is great I’m so relieved. But I also can’t help but feel even more angry at the police. It definitely wasn’t anywhere near as bad as what happened to me. But I thought maybe because my case was more easily proven I’d get in trouble. But I didn’t. So what are they actually doing? What happens if one day if someone hurts me so bad I die. Will they care then? When is enough enough? This all confirmed to me I can basically do whatever I want. The law was never real. Unless I do something so bad it kills someone or really badly hurts someone which of course I’d never do I’m pretty much fine. No one will ever care.",

September 1st 2023 my husband took his life in front of me, in our bedroom. I did chest compressions and stayed with him for almost 30 minutes waiting on paramedics.

    "I would be a mother of a toddler. 17F. Graphic details of misscarige. I don’t like to think about it much. I try to ignore it. Pretend it didn’t happen. I’ve not told anyone ever in my personal life about the pregnancy. I got raped at 14. It was my fault really. I was depressed because of bullying and past rape. So I started getting into drugs. And one of my dealers raped me. I started showing the signs but was scared to take a test or tell anyone. It was a few months before I built up the courage to take a pregnancy test. I wasn’t allowed to leave the house on my own because I had attempted suicide a week after the rape (before I started to think I was pregnant). So I asked my friend to meet me in town a week after as if it was just going to be to hangout and I was planning on stealing a pregnancy test without her noticing. In my head though I knew I was pregnant. I had a lot of pregnancy symptoms and I had a pregnancy belly. I was even lactating and didn’t have a period. So I had accepted I was most likely pregnant. And I started to feel somewhat comforted. I felt like maybe the baby would make me feel less alone. I started to imagine what names I would pick all that. Even though when I first started suspecting I was pregnant I thought for sure I would have an abortion. But I started weirdly being attached. I started looking after myself better. Because I didn’t want to hurt the baby more than I already probably had from the suicide attempt and the drugs and alcohol. But a few days before I was supposed to go to town I started having extreme stomach pain and started bleeding suddenly. Not like usual. I always had a really heavy period but this wasn’t like that. Within second I underwear was completely soaked through and dripping down my leg and I was in agony. I called my mother and she said it’s probably a really heavy period and gave me this really thicc pad thing. I crawled to the bathroom because I could barely walk and felt like I was going to faint. And actually thew up before actually being able to put the pad and new underwear on but once I was on the toilet there was parts of the feetus in broken up parts. I could make out some of its limbs. I flushed it away. I wish I kept it. So I couldve buried it. But I was so ashamed. I thought everyone would hate me. And they’d tell the police and the police would get me in trouble for doing drugs in the first place. I went through it all with no one. I had a bath and pretended none of this ever happened. I’ve been trying to forget. And sometimes I do. But when it comes back it hits me like a ton of bricks. I could have a toddler right now. My life would be completely different. Maybe I wouldn’t be so depressed now. Or maybe it’s for the best. Truthfully I know it was for the best. But it hurts. I feel like if I didn’t try to kill myself or do drugs id have a toddler. It would’ve been tough but my parents would’ve helped obviously I would’ve been a single mother. I wouldn’t be in school right now. The mistakes I’ve made since would’ve been detrimental. But maybe I wouldn’t have made mistakes quite so big. I went off the rails after the baby passed away. I didn’t care anymore. Nothing mattered. I know it’s delusional but I thought this baby was a sign. That I wasn’t supposed to kill myself. My purpose was to raise my baby. But then it was gone. Still to this day I can’t talk about it. It’s my deepest darkest secret which NO ONE knows. I feel even more traumatised and even more suicidal than I already was and it’s all my fault.",

But, this memory keeps popping up, and honestly has for many years, and I am too afraid to tell my therapist because I feel like it’s not legitimate or “bad enough” compared to what people go through. Would you consider this a trauma or a very embarrassing experience? When I was between like 6-8ish I was at a birthday party and was sitting in a circle with friends. It was a swimming party. This girl was way more popular than me and I was intimated by her lol. She had older cousins there who were soooo cool in my head. These older cousins were sitting a couple yards away from me and I turned around because I heard someone close to me suddenly and I was like omg they (older cousin) are talking to ME?!

    "Does anyone have a DECREASED startle response?. I have OCD and suspected PTSD as well. I’ve also had several depressive episodes. The event that caused me to develop both of the above occurred 15 years ago. I’ve had only negative experiences with therapy and meds (after many attempts at trying them across 5+ years), so I manage it without. After a very bad depressive episode during the pandemic (a time my PTSD was getting triggered and worsened repeatedly), I seemingly lost a lot of my emotions. I temporarily lost all fear of death/injury, which eventually came back. A lot of my emotions are still more blunted than they used to be. I thought this was dissociation for a time, but it never improved. Another interesting development is that I almost totally lost my startle reflex. I straight up cannot be jump scared anymore. A car barely missing me on the highway, someone putting their hand on my shoulder in the dark…99% of the time, absolutely 0 emotional response. I’ll still feel some physical symptoms of adrenaline like a sinking feeling, but I don’t feel scared or spooked at all. I actually discovered this is also true for panic attacks - I’ll still get them and have all the physical effects of fast heartbeat, dissociation etc., but I won’t feel fear. I’ve tried to figure out why this is and if PTSD can cause it, but obviously the reverse is much more common. Has anyone experienced this? Did fear ever come back for you?",
    "I was assaulted last november. I was raped and I just hate looking in the mirror and I find taking care of myself so scary but I'm trying to and it's so hard. My deceased mom would be so upset. How do I find the strength to move on from this pain? I've tried so hard. When will I feel free again? I feel very alone. Even getting a compliment which I honestly truly need and desire more of feels So wrong and uncomfortable and it's so heartbreaking!!!!! Because everytime I go back to that place with HIM. Why am I even feeling what I said...my heart hurts. what bothers me the most is this so called man, has gotten away with all of it. Is carefree and even denied everything he did to me many times. He was terrible. And I don't know if karma exists...where is it? I'm afraid to be or feel vulnerable and I get scared when any man looks at me. I feel like a caged bird....my heart aches for my old happiness and old self, I just want it back so badly. I guess I just want justice. I want the man who did this to me to die.",
    "Is there anything other than validation that someone gets from a diagnosis? Is it generally frowned upon to decline psychiatric meds if you are diagnosed?. I think I meet a lot of criteria for ptsd. Lots of adversity growing up. I struggle literally every day with intrusive thoughts. Sometimes I'm on the verge of tears if I'm left alone with my thoughts for too long. It's like flood gates. I can't stop the dwelling once it begins. Even as I actively remind myself to stop dwelling it's like an unstoppable force. Idk what to do. I'm afraid of psychiatric meds. What if they cause me to become a person I hate? I appreciate that my experiences have caused me to become a very thoughtful and mindful person but the days where it's bad I just want to drift into the wind and float away from everyone and everything.

I felt really good about myself initially from counseling but the last couple months I just feel like I'm in a rut. Does anyone have any advice for me?",
    "I just realized I've been sexual assault by a friend of mine. We were in my friends house to sleep over after the activities we've been from morning to evening, and it's no denying that I'm tired af As I was sleeping, I suddenly have this urge to woke up and I feel something warm on my left buttocks, it felt like a hand because of it's shape. I thought it's the cat first that's sleeping with us because it usually sleep with me, either behind my back or legs, but I noticed there's a heavy breathing behind me and shift movements too. I tried to calm myself because I can feel my heartbeat pounding loudly and I feared that he might feel it, so I tried to pretend to cough and try to move my position. After few minutes, I did it again and I turned my front body in front of him while I clutched the pillow, hiding my turmoil and the touching stopped there. I don't wanna doubt him because he have friends that was sexually abused and we even have a circle of friend that was sexually abused recently, which I think is fcked up if he will do that to me too It's no denying that I can't go back to sleep as I'm processing the situation. As much as I hate it, I want test it to see if he's really doing it or I'm just hallucinating because there's no way he will do that considering his female friend's experience on sexually assault So I turned my back against him and waited, waited, waited.... As I was losing my thoughts, I suddenly feel a hand again and he continues to do the same on my right buttocks He always retreat his hands after few seconds touch and then do it again, he was also touching my inner thighs back and forth while he do the same for my left waist and touched my pssy He even tried to lift my shirt on my back, but he stopped and instead decided to poke near breast instead. As he do these actions, I can hear his heavy breathing and in doubt he's fcking beating his meat I never felt this betrayed and disgust on my life, I've trusted him and I thought he's one of the guys who respect boundaries of his female friends' (I've consider telling this to our other friend who was sexually assaulted ) Question: Can I ask if I should pretend nothing happened?? I'm considering once we graduate, I'm planning to avoid him and even ghost him Update: So after they woke up, he acted like nothing happened even when we go to our respective homes I legit want to bash something rn",

    "PTSD from your own mental illness?. TW: brief mention of suicide/attempts (no methods) I (21F) have been professionally diagnosed with PTSD (specifically c-PTSD) for 4 years and have some mild symptoms that align with textbook PTSD such as flashbacks. But these are for unrelated reasons than what I describe below. I recently got out of a treatment resistant “double-depressive” episode that lasted about 3 years and nearly took my life twice. My providers and loved ones agree that it’s essentially a miracle I’m alive today. As a result, I have become so fearful of my past that it has caused a lot of distress. Seeing imagery of depressed/suicidal people in media gives me vivid flashbacks of how I was when I was in that state. It’s hard to interact with the items that remind me of how I attempted. I’ve had panic attacks over things like taking midday naps, feeling fatigued, or needing to take time to myself because I get so fearful of “enabling myself” to slip into another depressive episode. Given the length of my last episode and the mystery of how I got out of it, I know that a lot of my fear is not being able to climb out of the next episode I do have. I joke a lot about “giving myself PTSD,” but once I was made aware about how specific and irrational some of my behaviors were, it made me realize I had never seen someone else deal with this. Has anyone else felt like they’ve experienced PTSD-like symptoms caused by their own mental illness? I am becoming more aware due to my amazing therapist but it would be nice to know I am not alone in this.",
    "Talking to a therapist made me feel worse. I had my second session with a therapist today. I mainly thought I had ADHD but while talking about my background, my very violent childhood and social anxiety came up. The more I talked about it the worst I felt. She thinks that it might be ptsd and not adhd. But it just made me feel even more worse. Atleast with adhd it's a disorder. But ptsd just seems like a curse that was put on me. It was not something I chose. I've mostly just disassociated with it. But if my traumas are it I don't even know how long it will take to be better. I hate the feeling of hopelessness this brings. I cannot change my past. I cannot change what was done to me. I want to live my life as a normal person and be happy and care free. I was hoping just a pill would fix it. And logically I know it's more complex than that. But dear god, I was just hoping for an easier solution.",

I might get bloodwork just in case something else is up but this has happened for years :/ anything I can do? I was previously on prazosin which worked great but lowered my blood pressure too much which caused me to fall down if I got up in the night.

    "Is PTSD a lifelong condition?. I was diagnosed with PTSD earlier this year and have been in therapy since (trauma based CBT), almost finished my sessions. It’s been really useful and I’ve learned some great coping strategies and managed to process some of the trauma. The traumatic events my PTSD is linked to all happened within the last 3 years, not sure if that makes a difference to my question. I am still suffering with panic episodes in certain situations but am doing well with coping strategies which has allowed me to return to work where I’m a manager, work are being supportive and have made changes to certain parts of my job to help me manage. While it’s nice to be back in the real world again, it’s exhausting having to cope with these symptoms that I’ve never had to before when doing everyday things. My work is already mentally challenging. Everything feels a lot harder than it used to and I need to know if this is going to be a lifelong issue as I feel like I either need to just accept this is the way life is now or push through until it gets easier. Is PTSD a lifelong condition? I read it is and symptoms can come back in times of stress but I’d like to know if this relates to anyone’s reality? Will I always have to sit in meetings close to having a panic attack and having to convince my brain I’m not about to die while simultaneously trying to listen to someone talk?

    "Work triggers cause me to lose my job. Up until today, I was working in a barbershop. My boss pulled me aside about a week ago, and told me our owner had sent his \"secret shopper\" in, and that the secret shopper had told the owner that I asked if it was okay to shampoo his hair. She told me that the owner wants me to tell them we are doing a shampoo because it is included in the service, and that he doesn't want me to ask them. The owner says \"we are an upscale shop, people come in here for a high quality haircut and a shampoo.\" I told my boss that I completely understand that, and that I had a traumatic experience with people playing with the back of my hair, and that I liked to ask consent because if I didn't consent to that and someone did it to me, it would really freak me out. My boss basically said that she didn't care and to do it anyway. The level of stress that this has caused me has made me be in panic mode non-stop for the week and a half since then, and the idea of going has made me physically sick enough that I had to call out two separate days. Today I sat down with her and said that I didn't want my anxiety to be a reason for me to lose my job, because I really loved working there. She said she wouldn't budge on the fact that I can't ask for consent, I just have to do it. I did one haircut where I didn't ask, and the whole time it made me panic and I had to fight off tears until my customer left, and it sent me into a very deep spiral. I told her \"I just can't\" and that I needed to go, and she said then I was done.",

    "Daylight makes me depressed.. Not sure if this is the right place to be talking about it, but I have an idea that it might be, I don't know. Unlike so many people, I hate sunshine. Daylight, being awake during the day, having a nice bright day with clear skies - it makes me so depressed. The daylight reminds me of all the things I should be doing but I am not. It makes me feel like I should be productive and doing stuff, but I am not. I hear all the people frolicking outside and doing all sorts of fun activities, but I am not. It burns my eyes. It makes it abundantly clear just how poor, blurry and double my vision is. It shows me how dirty my room is because I don't clean enough. I watch the shadow of the tree branches, cast upon my walls, as they move with the wind and the sun glistens, and it makes me feel absolutely nothing short of horrible. It is dark now, and I feel relief. The night, for me, feels like such a sigh of relief. The day is over. I no longer need to be \"productive\" - it's so much more quiet outside. The only sounds I'm hearing on a Saturday night is the distant, deep rumble of the bass from loud music playing at some party far away from me. It is still summer, so people are heard talking, sitting and relaxing on their terraces and balconies, until that sound fades too. There is no pressure. Household members are slowly going to sleep. It is just me and my peace. My eyesight adjusts. Finally, a relief for my eyeballs as well - no more poking them with hot, burning rays of light. I can breathe a little easier. I hate the days, I love the nights. But this world forces me to live the other way around. The night promises I don't have to do anything, I'm not forced to participate in anything, and I get to say I'll try again tomorrow, even though I probably won't. But it's night time, so everything is allowed. I don't know what it is about the daylight that just works as the world's most effective anxiety booster for me. I am recovering from a several hour long daytime anxiety attack that wore me out completely. I am supposed to get more sunlight, for my health - how's this healthy?

    "I watched my dad die, now anxious about everything. Just to preface, feel free to ask me about any details. Anything I leave out here is purely because I want the post to be concise. Also, trigger warning, death, suicide, etc. The following is tough for me to type out because thinking about the events seem to bring me back to the emotions of that night. In June, it was a regular day on the farm, my dad is trying to fix the AC unit on our house. For context, he's been an HVAC technician for 20 years. I hear my brother scream to call 911. We all rush outside to see my dad on the ground with his arms drawn up. My brother did CPR while we waited for the ambulance. Fast forward to the hospital, the memories from which seem to be the worst of the trauma. We were there for about 3 hours in the ER watching them do CPR on him, then get a heartbeat, then he would go back into cardiac arrest. This happened 8 times. All I could do was sit there and cling on to the hope that maybe this time they would save him. The sound of those machines really haunt me. The sight of my dad, who was healthy as a horse a few hours before, lifeless on that hospital bed is burned into my brain. Since then, I've hardly had the chance to grieve him properly. Before he died, I was lucky enough that nobody close to me died. But over these past few months, people are dropping like flies. I won't go into detail, but my uncle died, as well as my aunt, and my neighbor. All natural causes, thankfully. But a few weeks ago, my friend committed suicide. I think that deserves a separate post. Now that you know the background, I want to talk about my current mental struggles. All things considered, I'm doing better than a lot of people would be. But I'm still incredibly anxious that something else catastrophic is around the corner. Whenever I see someone acting urgently, like my brother was, my mind goes to the worst case scenario and I break down. Even if they're just running to turn the water hose off, I seem to convince myself that they're running to help someone. I find myself thinking all day about what led up to these deaths, and what might cause the next one. What can I do to set my mind straight? Should I go to therapy? What are my options outside of therapy?",

    "Avoiding dentist. Feels like a long shot that someone who can relate will see this but I am looking for advice. The incident that gave me ptsd involved forcing something into my mouth. Since then I have had a very hard time at the dentist and it takes me a while to psychologically recover. My dentist doesn’t know about this, some staff at the office have been pretty unkind to me about cancelling appointments and not responding to calls to book which has meant I doubled down on avoiding it. I now have a broken tooth from the grinding I was supposed to be fitted for a night guard for, so it’s pretty critical that I go. How do I make this more doable and take care of my dental health? I never had any issues taking care of my teeth or going to the dentist before the incident happened, it feels stupid that I react this way but it makes me feel so out of control. Edit: Thanks for the replies. My dental work is now all completed and I thought I should share how it went. I added my PTSD diagnosis to my file so they’re aware and my dentist was clearly making an effort to make sure I was okay after that so that helped a lot. I had a fidget ring with me and my ear phones so i listened to a podcast throughout and it also helped to take a light sedative. I cried a lot when I got home but I think it was a positive release.

    "Physical Symptoms As A Result Of PTSD. Minor, diagnosed with PTSD last year as a result of family problems, which is not the topic of this post. First-time poster, recent-lurker. I haven't really had any reason to use Reddit nor peruse it, but I could use some like-minded folks' help. When I was diagnosed, I thought it was going to be the standard, stereotypical stuff; memories, nightmares, anxiety attacks and the like. I fall under enough of these categories to be professionally diagnosed, but I exhibited some additional symptoms as well that I hadn't really had the time to talk to my therapist about in depth, like if this was common or anything. My dad is unemployed and I cannot currently ask for a lot of help from her without being charged. While I'm entirely supported and my therapist and I are confident I can spend time away, it's also been hard given this is the longest I've gone without professional help since my mom was still living with us. Anyhow, I've always wondered if anyone with the diagnosis has experienced any of the following symptoms: - Extreme to moderate dizziness &amp; nausea upon enduring a trigger (will/can last days to weeks.) - Vomiting upon enduring a trigger - Going entirely mute for hours to days (although this has only happened once) - Similar, recurrent nightmares of things that have never happened to me, or at least to my memory - Extreme weakness and fatigue post-trigger It isn't much, and I know people can and will experience variants of some of these, but I'm mostly looking for anyone who's experienced dizzy spells.

It just didn’t work for me. I would hear things all the time like “the root cause of our disease is selfishness and self-centeredness”. I wasn’t either. In fact, my trauma made me people please and put others above me to a high degree. “You are not the main character.” We are the main characters of our lives in my opinion, but we must also consider others and not be selfish also. I never thought I was better than everyone else. I never jived with the God/higher power concept as an atheist.

Plus, most people in AA would frown upon my cannabis usage even though I’m using it for my PTSD and other trauma related disorders.

These days, it seems like all I get are hours long wait times on hold, even for chat or text, and then, if I hold out long enough, I get a person reading from a script so stringent that they might as well be a crappy 1999 AI chatbot (not even a very slightly less crappy modern AI chatbot) and going through the motions of \"active listening\" in bored monotone. The following is almost verbatim: Me: I've just been feeling so alone - it's making me feel like it doesn't even matter whether I live or die. Them: So ... what I am hearing is that you're feeling very alone and like it doesn't matter if you live or die. Me: Um ... yes. That's what I just said ... No offense, but you've literary just been ... paraphrasing everything I say back at me the whole time ... Is that standard operating procedure? Them: So, it sounds to me like you feel like I am just repeating everything you say back to you. Me: ... That is correct. Them: Great. Do you feel better now than you did when you first called? Me: To be honest ... I kind of feel worse. Them: Are you planning on harming yourself or others? Me: I have no concrete plans for the first one currently, no. And wouldn't do the second one, but ... Them: Great, well, I'm going to have to go now, but please feel free to call us again if you need to. Me: Oh ... Them: Have a wonderful day. Bye. And this isn't like a freak occurrence. It happens pretty much all the time, with multiple services, both via phone call and chat line. Maybe I'm just really unlucky? I understand they are understaffed and underfunded, but nowadays it feels like they are consistently doing active harm and I'd be better off if the option wasn't dangling there, like a rotten carrot, at all. One time I called at like 9 pm and was put on hold till 5 in the morning. No exaggeration. After the first half hour, I stayed in queue out of morbid scientific curiosity and sheer spite. When someone finally got back to me, it was more of the above, scripted parrot nonsense. The RAINN hotline, as I found out the hard way, literary just reroutes you to an apparently RANDOM local service that is in some way tangentially related to SA survivor \"support.\" It spat me out in some sort bureaucratic processing center attached to some branch of law enforcement, and it took the lady on the other side ten minutes to inform me that crisis support was not something they actually DO over there and that I shouldn't really have called them (which I didn't - I called the supposed \"hotline\" for RAINN. She was kind of rude and callous the whole time, sounded confused for most of it, and occasionally interjected with various right wing conspiracy theories seemingly unprovoked, but damn, a part of me was relieved just to be talking to what sounded like an actual, breathing human for a change. But basically, calling a number listed for RAINN just seems to roll the dice on whatever local \"affiliate\" happens to be on standby, and as far as I can tell there simply is no actual RAINN hotline. RAINN ain't never done jack for me or any other survivors I know, so I wonder where people's donations actually go, but perhaps it really varies. I dunno. This is as much a vent as anything else, but I would genuinely love to know if there are any decent options out there that have, in any way shape or form actually helped anyone? Am I just cursed? Or is this really the state of things? If the latter, I wish folks would stop bringing up these hotlines as some sort of catchall solution when one of us cries out for help and comfort, and instead just honestly tell us to shut up, which seems like what they really want to do but can't out of s sense of propriety and optics. Are these so called services just barebones shells that exist solely to reassure the abled friends and family of mentally ill folks that actually supporting us is something that can be conceptually relegated to some nebulous other?",

I promised myself that I would wait until after I publish my first book to commit suicide, but that's becoming only more difficult and I don't want to be around anymore. It feels like nobody genuinely cares about me. I got bullied and ignored at school, just to be abused at home, and I grew up having no one. We live in a cruel world, and I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm scared. I hope I die soon. I don't want to grow old.

    "Maintaining friendships while having PTSD. It really sucks when you look back at all of the friendships you’ve lost and see a common denominator in every single one of them. Even if it was an attack on me and not vice versa, I feel like my PTSD will never really allow me to have meaningful long-term relationships. It almost feels easier to just not have friends so you don’t have to worry about a potential of messing things up. It’s extremely hard to balance my needs and voice my opinions in a way that others are positively receptive to. Ugh.",

I’m on medication already I don’t want another that’ll help my nightmares but honestly it’s at the point I might. I’m so exhausted and feel like I’m being a terrible gf.",
    "I don't know how to tell my mom I have PTSD. I have a great relationship with my mom and have been living with her after I graduated earlier this year. She doesn't fully know why I am the way I am and I feel like this creates unnecessary misunderstandings between us. I really struggle with being alone with other people and it's difficult and draining for me to talk to others in general. Most of my enjoyment from life comes from creating art and stories, but when I do she sees it as \"doing nothing\". I've been putting off finding an in-person job (I work remotely) and i can tell my mom is frustrated by this because she wants me to do something that pays better. Of course I understand her perspective, she's going to want me to move out eventually and my current job is not going to be enough. I feel somewhat stuck: I don't have the money for therapy and my PTSD is holding me back. I keep wondering if I tell her she might help me cover the costs. The thing is, I didn't live with her when I was younger and she knows I suffered emotionally from my living situation at that time, but she does not know about the CSA I experienced. I feel like I could never share the trauma I went through with her because it involves my brother who died when I was 14. Part of my daily struggle with PTSD is my own perception of my brother, and wondering why someone who I loved would do what he did to me. I realized I had PTSD when he was alive, but his death made it much worse. I feel like I cannot share this with anyone who knew him because it will put them through the same mental battle and anguish I've had to experience since.",
    "Was surprised today from someone who I thought was mean. I’m currently staying at an inpatient clinic for mental health and a nurse who has always been blunt in manner to me ( I haven’t seen her interact with anyone else just my impression of her was she was not a very kind person )… lss we are not allowed cigarettes in the ward and she saw one fall out of my pocket when I was going out for leave I freaked and started crying because I thought I was going to get kicked out by her. She told me to relax and that she couldn’t give my cigarettes back. I went back to my room and decided to ask for my unescorted leave to be taken off me so I can quit and stop buying them. Before I was going to say that she took me back to my room gave my cigarettes back and told me not to tell anyone because she thinks I’m a beautiful girl and it’s unfair to get kicked out for something like a cigarette. I stared at her in shock as up until this point ( ha I’m leaving on Monday and was joking in my head today to say to her before I left “has anyone ever told you your a bitch” I would never actually say that just she doesn’t have very good bedside manner) but anyway it taught me today that I have very strong opinions with people and I’m still a very black and white thinker and taught me something that I can’t put into words if someone could help me if they understand my point. That’s my rant",
    "[M39] [F40] Husband tremendous amount of grief and emotional pain. I think he has PTSD?. Trying to understand more on how my husband process his grief, it like he in this tremendous amount of grief and emotional pain. Sorry I'm Chinese, and English is my third language. It alot of unpack, in the 14 years together with my husband. His older sister died of car accident on freeway, a drunk driver crashed into her, on freeway she died on scene. When his father died of pancreas cancer, he was the one that care for him to his last months by his dad bedside, when his dad took his last breath, he sit he sit there with his dad dead body for 12 hours (Rigor mortis was basically sets in), we (me and his mom) have no choice but to call the hospice so the hospice doctor can come and declare his father time of dead. He was holding his dad dead body for 12 hours and not want to let his dad go. ....... The funeral was he prepaid for his father, so the funeral people come and put a tag on his dad foot, and cover his dad body a white sheet, and got his dad body out to funeral van. His mom basically sit there and just cry her eyes out. Him not only he bawl but he also literally follow his dad body to the funeral van, and he run after the funeral van as it drove away. His mom 4 years ago since she had a massive hemorrhagic stroke didn't kill her but leave her quadriplegia paralyze, and also her kidney failure. It has been since my husband overwork himself to pay for his mom Private Nursing home so she can have quality care doctor and a team of nurses care for her around the clock. He also prepaid for her funeral and gravesite so she can be buried near his dad. He also take his mom to Dialysis 4x times per week, as well as one weekend out of the month is his mom with us in our home and he care for her 24/7 that that 2 days, while 28 days is she at Nursing home. His mom is dying due to her kidney failure end stage. 5 years ago in 2019 our toddler/the child of me and him died of brain disease( the baby got brain disease inherited genetic from me the mom side) specialists said our child won't live pass age 2. My husband care for our child in that 1.5 years of our child life in and out of the hospital, he watch our child die slowly and there nothing he can do. He keeps our child ashes urn with him right in our child's room. He dust the room, touch our child ashes urn cries and talk to our child ashes, the room never change a single thing since the passing of our child, and it been 5 years since our child died. In 2021 I had a near death experience, I was discharge home with hospital bed, bedridden and with oxygen tank hook in my nose 24/7. My husband took off work and care for me day and night for a whole month. The bedridden me defecate on myself and my husband clean my defecation that whole month. He also sleep with a pillow and a blanket on the carpet right by my bedside (we had a hospital bed in our bedroom got discharge home with it and oxygen tank). I guess it our child death, and then me almost die, I basically saw him cries everyday. So so much tears from him, and emotional pain. Many times he bawl, not just cry, completely bawl, so much to the point he has both hands on his head and bawl to the point collapse and curl up in a ball on the ground. His emotions is just INTENSE. Even in his deep sleep he bawl, I do not know why but tears just roll down his face and he bawl in his sleep. I did recover thank you to him care for me. Many times he hugged me and said he very afraid (as in he very afraid that I will die). I don't know if it his father death, our child death, and my near death experience all build up together. This was when he started to cut his stomach with a kitchen knife, he said stomach skin is thinner and has more nerves so it hurts more, and nobody see his stomach than if it was on his legs of arms, so he chose to cut his stomach, he cuts deep the point bleeding that he has bandage wrap around his waist bleed. And that was how I first time found out about he cut himself too was I saw the bloody bandage wrap around his waist when he took his shirt off. His emotions is just so INTENSE, and his grief is just so intense it like he crave the physical pain to mask his grief. He still has the scars on his stomach from he cut his stomach with the kitchen knife. He doesn't cut himself anymore, he said he will continue live for me, I am the reason why he still living. This is why I am taking care of my health, I must be healthy for him. He said if I happen to go before him (die before him), he will go with me. And don't I say that he leaving anyone behind because he not, his older sister died, his father died, his child the child with me and him died, his mother soon will be die too she quadriplegia and end stage kidney failure. And if I die too. Who is he leaving behind? He said he will die with me, because on the other side has his father, his child, has me, and we be a family again. Can it be his PTSD talking? He said if I die before him, my ashes will be with him by his side just like our child ashes with him. My husband whom 39 (which is not old for a man), and he already have a Will sign in front of a lawyer. And he already Prepaid for his own cremation, arranged with the funeral director, once he die he wants to be cremate and mix his ashes with me and our child together three of us, and scatter it. He does not want to be buried. His will actually very straightforward. If he die first, all his assets and his everything he has all go to me. He didn't name anyone else beside me. But if I die first, if I die before him, he already has a lawyer to take care of his assets (donate to children brain disease research due to our child died of brain disease), and in his will he state the funeral director (he already Prepaid) will cremate him, and mix his ashes with mine and our child and scatter it. What is going on with my husband? He has PTSD? It like he in a tremendous amount of grief and pain due to he one by one loss all his blood immediate family. I'm trying to get him to a grief therapist, but he not want to go. So I am still trying.",
    "What to do as a spouse of someone with PTSD?. I feel like a horrible wife. My spouse has CPTSD and while he’s been in therapy for a while, he’s convinced therapy won’t help. He stays inside all day and it’s really difficult to get him to leave the house. We’ve had really good discussions where he opened up and I felt like we were making progress together. I’m proud of the work he’s done and doing, but he has moments where he slips back, and things escalate quickly into anger and intense anxiety on his end, making it impossible to have productive conversations or help him calm down. He’s been the best supporter to me with my personal issues, but I feel like I haven’t been a great support system in return. Because of my issues (that I’m working very hard on), I don’t do well with confrontation, raised voices, or anger. Basically when he escalates, I shut down. His trauma isn’t about me, but I feel like I’m slowly breaking. I would never dream of leaving him because I love him very much, but I don’t know how to be supportive in a way that’s healthy for both of us. I’m posting here in hopes that I can get some perspective and learn to do better from other partners/supporters, or people with PTSD who have a partner. How do you guys do it? What’s worked for you?",
    "I just realized i havnt had ptsd flashbacks in months!. My old doctor never even tried to help my ptsd but i got a different doctor about a year ago and we almost immediately started working in finding a good medication combination and dosage that would work for me. Took about 6 months but we finally have it! I have ptsd from a horrendous car accident i witnessed and literally anything that wasnt just normal driving would give me flashbacks. I delt with this for 3 years! The screams and smell of the man burning to death haunted me. Even if i was at home or work and just heard honking or breaks squealing outside id get flashbacks. It's been months now with no flashbacks! Im so happy!",
    "Still alive.. I constantly want to die to prevent myself from experiencing more trauma and pain, especially now that I have PTSD-induced chronic pain, but I decided a number of years ago that I can and will never, ever kill myself. To simplify my reason why, the rest of my immediate family died except my grandparents so if I died, the amount of suffering it would cause them on top of what they have already endured would be unconscionable. I love them too much. On top of that, a large part of me also WANTS to live! There are so many things you can only experience while alive, for me it's experiencing nature, love, art, etc. If I died, I'd lose out on every opportunity I'll ever have to see and experience things that bring me positive emotions. I want to travel to different places and see cool animals and listen to good music and eat good food. Sometimes, lately more often than not, it feels like the pain is too much and it outweighs the positives, but that's when I fall back on my main reason: can't because of the grandparents. Anyways, it's my birthday and I'm kind of quietly celebrating to myself that I decided to keep living. It hasn't been easy and the past few months have actually been some of the most difficult/triggering since the trauma that originated my PTSD. But despite the recurring suicidal thoughts, I'm still here, still alive, and I'm not planning on going anywhere no matter how painful it gets. Go me. If you read this, go you. I honestly think we've got this even though its painful.",
    "Anyone here with a psychotic disorder?. Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone here has a psychotic disorder that could help to mark the difference between a very vivid thought and a flashback. As part of my psychotic disorder, my thoughts form as very vivid pictures where I can almost feel myself in it. For example, I will get thoughts of self harm to the point I can feel myself doing it. I was told in PTSD therapy that any change in senses is a flashback, including sight. But if I have these thoughts as vivid images, how do I tell if it's an intrusive thought or a flashback?",
    "I keep having nightmares and they won't stop. I hate sleeping because all of my dreams are about SA. It's not even about what actually happened, it's just about SA. And it's so disgusting that it makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I've woken up on the verge of puking because of how horrible my nightmares were. The worst part is most of the time it involves incest, and it sickens me It makes me feel so disgusting and I just want it to stop. I've only just realized this has to do with my trauma but it has been happening nonstop since then. Even when my dreams aren't about rape they're about sex or are just sexual in nature, and it's sickening. So much of my mind is filled with sex and I don't even want it to be, it makes me feel so gross. I don't know how to stop it. I don't know what to do",
    "Some news making PTSD worse (TW: SA and Murder). The guy that sexually assaulted me confessed to murdering someone back in May. This really fucked me up. It helped in some ways as there is justice for the woman he murdered, as it was a 7 year old cold case and I no longer feel as guilty as if the assault was my fault. I am just really broken by the pain he has caused others and i am so scared and sad for my teenage self. I know it’s a little absurd, but the fear I feel right now for younger me is intense. More details have been coming out about the case and it’s sick. He came over to her house with intentions to have sex with her whether or not it was consensual and ended up murdering her because she asked him to leave. I will never know how much danger my younger self was in. My heart is breaking for my younger self and the woman he murdered. I don’t want to say it could have been me because my circumstances were different as I was best friends with his sister, but I think it is safe to say I was in danger. I am dealing with a bit of survivors guilt and I just feel so sad and angry. His mom and sister constantly excused his actions and I have reasons to believe they knew about the murder and were protecting him all this time. I think his confession and imprisonment will eventually heal me in some ways, like the art of kintsugi, but I am going to be broken for a while longer.",
    "I Think I Have PTSD And I’m Terrified. TW for mania and some parental drama Without going into too much detail, I had a very hard period of my life back in April. I was already incredibly depressed in my first year of college, overwhelmed with academic and social stress. Then, my parents divorced. I knew it was coming for a long time, but I didn’t want to admit it. The next few days, my mother starts saying very weird things to me about spirituality and how everyone is secretly connected and how “they” are talking to her. I’m in college 3 and a half hours away from home, and I only talk to her through these phone calls where she’s telling me that she’s receiving all of these messages about the rapture. I wake up the next day with a message from my 14 year old sister. Apparently, my mom took her outside to “see the moon” and said all these disturbing things about spirituality to her. I was scared for my sister’s safety at this point, so, an hour before class, I call my mom to tell her that I’m worried about her. She starts screaming. Have you heard a manic person scream? It’s the most terrifying sound I’ve ever heard in my life. She tells me that she doesn’t love me, that I’m the only thing preventing her from being happy. I’m in ensemble rehearsal when I get a call from my dad. My mom was admitted to a mental hospital. They had to call 911. I wanted to see them, to see that they were okay. But I was 3 and a half hours away, and I had a wind ensemble concert tonight. So I stayed at college until the weekend. Things are better now. The doctors confirmed that my mom was in a manic state. She was in hypomania for another 2 months as college began to end. There was another episode in June where I was home and she started saying all these spiritual things to me again, but it wasn’t that bad. After all, I knew it was mania. Back in college, my first fear was that she was okay, was that she meant everything she said to me. After that, everything was okay again. She’s back to normal- no, she’s better than her normal. She’s happier, she stresses herself out less, she has contacts in case she has another episode. We have grown so close over the past few months, and I’m so eternally grateful to have my mom back. My dad and my mom got back together over the course of the last few months as my dad really began to step up. He was always a great person with pure intentions, but he’s recently really learned to listen to our problems and work to help us. I’m so grateful for the new him. Fast forward to this morning. I’m checking my rehearsal schedule for the next week, and, at the end of the announcement, my band director writes, “I wish I could write more, but I have to go attend to my daughter. It’s her birthday today! Happy practicing!” Something in me started to break. I thought of my dad and then the divorce and then my mom’s mania and then I was there again, back in class receiving the call that my mom was admitted to the mental hospital. I was in a state of panic for an hour before I successfully calmed myself down. Ive had flashbacks before, but this one just broke me. It’s been 6 months- why am I still thinking about this? Why do I feel this way? Why do I avoid everything that reminds me of the spring? So I did some research and then it hit me: oh man I think I have PTSD. It feels so weird. For the last 6 months, I’ve been trying to convince myself that it wasn’t that bad. Lots of people divorce! I was just being sensitive. It wasn’t that bad, really. But can’t pretend it doesn’t hurt anymore. I feel weirdly healed and broken at the same time. I don’t really know what to do now, but I really just need to share this experience. Even just writing this has helped me a lot. Thank you for reading this far if you’re still here :)",
    "Triggered by a gold fish.. I just got triggered by a dead fish. My sister bought my nephew a fish from a fair they went to. It didn't last a week. I was the first to find it. It gave me pretty intense flashbacks to 2017 when my dad died, and we had to reclaim my grandma's house from the addicts his pastor convinced him to house there. The addicts attempted to steal my dad's truck, so I and my sister drove with them to Kensington PA where they picked up some drugs. We returned to my grandma's house, and the next day one of them ended up overdosing and I discovered their blue, lifeless corpse, mouth agape. like that fish. I wasn't really expecting that to come up. But here we are.",
    "Dealing with older people who just don't understand.... I'm a new Christian and honestly coming to Christ has helped me a lot with my symptoms of anxiety and depression. I've been diagnosed with PTSD for the past 13 years and I'm on disability. I've come a long way over the past year, I can go to church, I can be social when it comes to talking about scripture which I'm passionate about but I shy away with anything outside of that and I go to Bible study. It's taken months to get relatively comfortable with the people there and it's taken a lot of energy to do so. I was kinda proud of how far I've come. Until today. I had seen something online that bothered me, I brought it up to a church elder whom I trusted because I trusted his judgement and it kinda...devolved into a chastisement of not arguing with people online and that I have too much time on my hands, that I should go out and work to put my faith into practice and do physical labor instead of being at home all the time online and reading my Bible (which is one of the few things that I ACTUALLY enjoy anymore). It wrecked me because...I do put my faith into practice. It's how I've come as far as I have. I can agree with him that yeah, sometimes I get carried away with a discussion and get frustrated and argue with the person I'm talking to and I need to learn to step away from those conversations, but he just saw me offer time to help someone who's struggling yesterday... to imply that I don't put my faith into practice was hurtful. And then, the reason for this post here, he was pushing for me to work for free at the church during my free time to be of help and saying I need to do physical labor, and when I tried to explain to him I deal with anxiety due to PTSD he kinda brushed me off saying \"Oh we all deal with anxiety.\" I tried to explain that I look a lot more put together than I really am, and he brushed it off again saying everyone is that way. I've run into similar issues with my aunt who is around his age (50's to 60's) does anyone else run into this issue where it seems older people don't understand the concept of mental illness? That it's not something you can just get over overnight? That when I tell him I deal with anxiety, he doesn't realize the effort it takes to just walk outside the door to go to church. I come home and I collapse because I'm so exhausted from the emotional and mental strain. I don't know. I'm just hurt and I don't think I'm going to go to him again for spiritual needs or comfort. I want to continue in my walk with God, so I'll put some emotional walls up with this guy specifically because I love my church and the other members and I love Bible study. These are things I look forward to every week.",
    "does anyone else trip out after social engagements?. whenever i get home from seeing people - 2 people, 20 people, doesn’t matter - i ruminate and get paranoid over what i said, what they said, whether they meant what they said, whether what i said was taken how i meant it or if i came off in a way i didn’t intend. it’s torturous and makes me not want to see people, except i know i need to see people and have community and friends and support. does anyone know what this response is from a PTSD perspective and how i can flip the narrative so that i can overcome it? helpful suggestions welcome!",

Once I was no longer scared to be alone, I have been loving it. Now it has been years however, and I’m noticing that, yes I have changed my behavior and boundaries, Which does alter my already existing connections (not partying/not partaking in drugs, not wanting to go to bars/clubbing) but my lack of social life isn’t just from altering my interests. It’s becoming clearer to me that I simply don’t put in enough effort to socialize because I don’t trust anyone (and feel justified in this) anyone else struggles with this? What steps did you take to learn to trust or even just at least fake it till you make it? I think it’s getting worse and I would like to have friends, but no one around me seem to understand the grind I’m on"

    "How true is this Stanford Professor explanation of Schizophrenia?. In this section of this lecture, the professor explains schizophrenia as a thought disorder. He claims one of the symptoms of schizophrenia is difficulty thinking abstractly. He says that people with schizophrenia get stuck thinking concretely. https://youtu.be/nEnklxGAmak?t=1773 He uses phrases with non literal meaning, and the examples of how a schizophrenic person would interpret them. How true is this? He says that the phrase: “loose lips sink ships” to a non-schizophrenic person would be understood as “if you tell secrets to other people, we could get in trouble.” (loose lips == someone who can’t stop talking) (sinking ships == people getting in trouble) but to a schizophrenic person, they might have trouble decoding the sentence because they’d imagine gigantic lips in the ocean sinking a ship. maybe this is overly simplistic but i’m curious about this assessment.",

    "Assassination Attempt on Trump at Mar-a-Lago- Shooter Appears to be Mentally Ill. Clarification edit: This occurred at Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, *not* Mar-a-Lago. I can't fix the title, sorry. So... there was an incident today involving someone who appears to be mentally ill attempting to assassinate former president Donald Trump (yet *another* assassination attempt). It's always such a delight when high-profile acts of violence that can be tied to mental illness happen, always great optics for the mentally ill. A little breakdown on the shooter: [https://www.thedailybeast.com/who-is-alleged-trump-golf-course-gunman-ryan-wesley-routh](https://www.thedailybeast.com/who-is-alleged-trump-golf-course-gunman-ryan-wesley-routh) For those not aware of this most recent development, the alleged shooter (Ryan Wesley Routh) attempted to assassinate former president Trump at his golf course in West Palm Beach. It goes without saying that attempting to assassinate Trump there is not something any sane or rational person would do- the grounds were swarming with Secret Service agents, so it's like trying to rob Fort Knox solo. He was intercepted by Secret Service and fled, later arrested a county away in Florida. Major print outlets seem to have noted his flat affect when he was arrested. A lot of his history is erratic, his political beliefs wildly inconsistent and swinging from side to side repeatedly, and he also had an 'incident' in 2002 which involved an armed standoff with police officers. One of his old neighbors described him as \"cuckoo\" and said that everyone in town was afraid of him... which leads us to the conclusion that 'politics' is tangential to the motive, and that Routh is not a mentally stable individual. There is no *known* link to schizophrenia- or psychosis- just yet, but we do not know enough currently to speculate in any meaningful way whether or not psychosis was involved. We are going to make *this* exception to our rule on 'no politics' because of the nature of this incident. It is likely based on historical trends that once this conversation hits the mainstream, there will be outside agitators coming in to drop their ~~shit takes~~ inadequately informed opinions on schizophrenia and violence. Luckily, I [just did a write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/about/wiki/rules/stigma/#wiki_schizophrenia_and_violence) over this very thing- but if someone comes here with obvious ulterior motives in the next few days, please ***report them to us*** so we can deal with it ASAP. Interlopers and agenda-posters are not welcome here. So... this thread is a freebie for political discussion so long as it remains civil. Have at it- and remember, Reddit nukes accounts for anything resembling a \"call to violence\" or anything remotely resembling glorifying it. Last time that was something to the effect of 'wish he was a better shot,' and just this week we've already had the admins suspend a couple people's accounts for something that could be interpreted as glorifying violence (not my call, can't weigh in on it in any meaningful way). Reddit is not messing around when it comes to this election cycle- something to be aware of as you write your comments. Thank you. Update: ... okay, so this just continues to get more and more wild. We have our [friend of the family](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1fhwlj2/comment/lnd9gty/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) here in the comments who seems legit (has correctly described the Routh house prior to any video footage of it being released), and some interesting stories from [other neighbors](https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/trump-florida-suspect-ryan-wesley-routh/) who paint a picture of a very 'particular' individual. I suppose 'pimp' and slinging dope are now on our list of unusual occurrences. I'm kinda at a loss here. I'm leaning towards \"untreated bipolar with a meth habit\" but who even knows. I suppose I am looking forward to when the final investigation from the FBI and Secret Service is completed, because this whole thing is just frankly wild as hell. I'm thinking this guy might even surpass the guy who set himself on fire outside of Trump's fraud trial in terms of 'just batshit crazy' individuals who seem to keep showing up and doing things that are insane nonsense that just so happens to be proximal to politics. Absolutely bonkers... and that's coming from *me.*",

    "I'm so tired of religious people telling me their diety will fix me. I grew up in a delusionally religious household where my family was poor and believed prayer heals people and there isn't much use to spend money on doctors when you have \"god\". No matter how hard I try to get these people to understand, they are still fixated on making sure I know \"their god could fix me if I just believed.\" This bothers me for multiple reasons. One, they are incapable of truly understanding what it is they're claiming can be fixed. Two, they are automatically assuming one hasn't already tried that without actually knowing. Three, it implies they believe they are better than the one they are offering \"guidance\" to. Four, their deity likely doesn't even exist. Does anyone else get tired of dealing with religious people telling the mentally ill their god can fix them and that the mentally ill individual is not handling it as well as they would if they were the one dealing with the illness?",

She told me we were the same, both broken trust and scared of each other. The difference is her feelings are based on prejudice ideas about bipolar people and mine are based on her actual actions. She tried to make me move out, I had to explain that that was bullshit and if she has a problem she’s going to have to break the lease herself. I’m so sad. I was finally getting my feet under me and now I feel unsafe and scared in my home and uncertain about the future. What a cruel, cruel person. And she thought she was in the right! What a fucked up world we live in. Edit: thank you all for your responses. I’ve put a new doorknob with a key lock on my room and I’m getting a camera for the main area. I talked to the leasing office and hopefully she’ll move out soon. I had learned the hard way not to tell anyone at work about my diagnosis - I guess I just learned not to tell anyone else, either.",

    "Overheard coworkers talking about bipolar… :(. I’m at work today in a new job (paralegal, just started a month ago) and i kinda hate it because the work life balance is shit and it’s def affected my mental health. BUT i need an income so I’m here while i’m applying elsewhere. My coworker and one of the attorneys were talking about their weekend and my coworker (another paralegal) said “oh mine was terrible because my boyfriend’s awful cousin came to visit. She’s bipolar and she’s stable but her stupid routines make her so obnoixious. She goes to bed early and exercises and can’t drink much and takes these meds” and went on about how annoying people with bipolar are. then the attorney agreed and was like yikes she’s awful. i know they’re not talking about me, and that everyone with bipolar is so different. But i can’t help but feel crushed and disheartened by the way she spoke about her boyfriend’s cousin. I felt myself just shrivel and feel small and helpless. She just described bipolar as though it’s some irredeemable trait and it made me feel like shit. i’ve been like shaking ever since. No one at work knows, and I don’t plan to tell them (especially now). But it makes me nervous for the future. We don’t get a lot of PTO and our sick days come out of our PTO. The work has taken a quick toll on my mental health because i dislike it so much and brought up some old thoughts of SH and SI, which i’ve been managing with my psych and therapist. I’ve worked hard to keep my routines that help me like exercise and sleep and journaling and other things. But my second week and family member passed away and it hit me so hard. I took a day to go to the funeral, then the following day I just couldn’t handle going into work and lied about being super sick. But what if something more serious happens and I need more than just 1 day off? Taking sick days is really frowned upon. I’m just ranting because I’m so shaken up by this. I know this role isn’t for me and i’m trying to get out as fast as i can. I just wanted to vent to some people who may understand :(. thanks for reading.",

About 6 months ago, I decided that I wanted to try and be sober from cocaine and alcohol, I put myself into an outpatient treatment center. There, they provide services such as weekly meetings and also therapy and psychiatry. Things were going well, I wasn’t going to as many meetings as I wanted to, but I had a good relationship with both my therapist and psychiatrist. I went in to the center because it was time for me to get a refill on my medication. I have been feeling manic lately and I mention this to my psychiatrist, I asked her if we can go up on the mg of my meds because I had been on my current dose for about a month. She smiled at me and told me that I was snorting my pills. I thanked her for her time, stood up and walked out of her office. This whole interaction really fucked with me, I have worked my ass off through my sober journey and I feel like she just shat on it by accusing me of snorting a drug that doesn’t even get you high.",

    "Wife said she's done and wants a divorce :-/. After 16-17 years of a relationship, two kids, and 11-12 years of marriage my wife said \"she's done, has nothing left for me, and there is no marriage to save for her\" I spent the first 12 years or so of our marriage undiagnosed, unmedicated, and uncounseled. To say that I was unstable is an understatement. Both of our kids were born during this time, I was a shit partner and a shit father, I was so very lost and she gave everything to keep our relationship together. Each time there was a big change in our relationship/lives I'd have an episode (weeks leading up to our marriage, our first and second children being born, the last episode lasted months and I tried to implode our marriage the entire time saying horrible things about us, my love for our family, myself...it was awful). This never happened again but our relationship has been riddled with emotional instability on my part up until very recently. About 4 years ago I got my initial diagnosis of ADHD followed closely by Bipolar and I started getting some help, it took about a year before I was on medication that helped in some way, and even then I wasn't on all the meds I needed (only prescribed a mood stabilizer with immediate release to treat the ADHD). Just recently, after all this started happening, I found a new counselor and psychiatrist that got me on the correct medication (mood stabilizer, anti-psychotic, anti-anxiety, extended release for ADHD) and it's made a huge difference. Fast forward to six months ago and my wife comes to me saying that she doesn't think we're compatible anymore, that we want different things, that we don't make each other happy anymore. I tell her that I'll help in any way I can, that I understand what it's like to question everything and to let me know what she needs. I offer to do any work needed, I commit to couples counseling (we go a total of three times over three months with the last two sessions essentially informing the counselor of our separation) Weeks turn into months and things just stay the same, until they don't...one week we're talking about how we're in this together, that I need to work on myself to help us, and we can do this. Two weeks later we're telling the kids we're separating, and a week after that I move out of the house into my BIL's place... It all happened so fast, I was just in mental triage dealing with things as they came, one hit after the other...now it's been three months since I've lived in a house I still pay for (my portion of rent+expenses) and I'm having a really hard time this week. I'm in a lot of mental pain, everything hurts...this disorder takes so much from us and I feel hopeless more often than I feel hopeful. EDIT: Removed med names and clarified the home situation",
    "You are so strong. I have suffered from depressive episodes since I was 6 years old. At the age I (kind of adorably) tried to smother myself with a pillow. I, of course, pulled it off because I couldn't breathe and my body wouldn't let me. I'm now 37 and received a bipolar diagnosis just over a year ago. But this is about you. So many voices here. Screaming into the void. Suffering. Your pain is heard. I understand it and I hate it for you. When that dark cloud sets in and all you can do is wail into a pillow...what a mighty roar you have. What amazing capacity for feeling you possess. When you feel nothing. When all you can do is stare at the wall and drool onto your bedspread for a few hours. How damn impressive it is that you are doing what needs to be done. When you feel you are failing. You feel the need to \"do better\" but all you can do is feel stuck in frenzy and go on Reddit to tell someone. You have the might of a god. The little things matter. Breathing matters. For us, doing nothing takes so much more effort than it does for others to be productive. It doesn't stop the suffering, but know that you are strong. Look back at your life. At the small things you have done to hide your depression. What a mighty person you truly are. If only you knew. I'm aware that this can hurt to hear. It hurts me every single time I say it to myself. But it also gets me in the shower. It gets me out of bed. It also gets me in bed without shame. Not every time. It's not always successful. That's not the point, though. The point is that it only helps me at all because it's true. Our illness feeds us many lies. The truth is, you are stronger than the pain you feel. 🖤",

People such as myself often get labled as crazy or broken becasue of this. We aren't crazy or broken. It is a struggle to maintain my emotions personally but i deal with the disorder just fine.

    "BP 2 peeps — what are your symptoms of hypomania?. For a long time I didn’t understand the difference between true mania and hypomania. I would get confused because I felt that my “manic episodes” weren’t as harmful / severe as how other ppl described it. Now I understand that I’ve mostly only had hypomania and it makes a lot more sense. My hypomanic episodes usually begin with me just thinking I’m in a good mood (which is lowkey rare lol). It’s often triggered by lack of sleep and/or stimulants. I always have this feeling of wanting to talk for hourssss. Like it’s actually uncomfortable how much I crave socialization and to just talk someone’s ear off… I think this is probably one of my most regrettable symptoms because I always end up oversharing, sometimes even with strangers. I also always get anxiety after because I worry that I weirded someone out or wasted their time. My other symptoms are reckless driving (mostly just faster than usual but this is def the most harmful/scary behavior), extreme optimism, excessive confidence, hyperfixation of random research/art project, making random plans that I’ll never follow thru with, insomnia, disassociation, rapid speech+flight of ideas, and hypersexual thoughts. Most of my episodes are pretty short, usually 1-2 days, except for the occasional 4-5 day long eps (often when I am consistently sleep deprived).

He’s on his game right now, and obviously disappointed we turned the movie off. I hate that I have to be so sensitive with myself. I hate the strict sleep schedule. Asleep by 9:30 awake by 6:45. Taking medication twice a day. I hate not being able to have as much fun and enjoy things the way I used to do. I can acknowledge some things just simply aren’t healthy for me like it is others, and it’s hard to accept.

    "tired of dating as a woman with bipolar. I’m 19F in college and recently single, and since I’ve gotten back out into the dating world it seems like I can’t find anyone who understands me. It’s all men who think I’m just “hot and crazy”, compare me to manic pixie dream girl characters, and one has even encouraged me stop taking my meds. It feels like the people attracted to me want to take advantage of me in some way because I’m impulsive and emotionally vulnerable, and it absolutely sucks. I’m open about having bipolar because it feels like a necessary thing to mention to someone I’m seeing in case I have another episode, and I know that dating me can be intense because of my symptoms. I just wish that the people who were up for the challenge didn’t fetishize me because of this illness. Hopefully it’ll change when I get older, but right now I’m just angry and sad about all this. I really enjoy finding romantic connection, but at this point it seems impossible for someone I’m interested in to really understand me. Sorry for this kinda trivial rant, I needed to get this out somewhere. Edit: To clarify, since I’m seeing a lot of the same comments, this isn’t information I’m just handing out willy-nilly. If a guy asks or if it comes up naturally, I’m honest about it, but I’m not like “Hey I’m [name] and I’m bipolar”. When I said recently single, I meant it’s been a few months, so I’ve had time to actually get to know a few people and they’ve all fetishized my symptoms once it gets to the point where it does come up.

It greatly impacted my decision making in all aspects of life and it’s taken years to come to terms with.

    "How many of you had your first episode of mania later in life?. I was first diagnosed with schizophrenia, but then had a manic episode when I was roughly 30 which is later than lots of people. My diagnosis since changed to schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. So just curious how many of you also experienced mania later in life? I think usually people with bipolar disorder/schizoaffective disorder develop it in their early 20s so just wondering how much of an anomaly I am I’m getting myself worried because the last 24 hours I’ve not slept and my mind has been racing and I feel incredible fidgety, all this happened on my last episode of mania so I’m worrying and panicking a bit Appreciate any kind words and support **Thank you everybody for sharing your story, appreciate your help**",

    "Just wanted to share my story.I don't know if anyone cares, I don't care anymore. Here’s some context: I’m a 27-year-old engineer. My family is full of mentally unstable people. I live in Europe, but I’m not European. I’ve been here for 4 years now, and I don’t know anyone. I’m by myself. Let’s just say I came here to study and chase a dream. Partially, I achieved it—I studied at one of Europe’s top 3 universities, but yeah, it doesn’t feel that important anymore. I got my diagnosis in January 2018: bipolar disorder type 2. At first, I wasn’t upset about it. In fact, it was almost a relief because the diagnosis gave me an answer to a long-standing question: Am I different? I guess I got my answer. The cycles of this disorder are killing me. Every time I’m broken, I rebuild myself, only to get broken again. And with each cycle, I feel like I’m losing pieces of my true self. I’m becoming a shell of who I used to be. I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I feel lonely, even when I’m surrounded by people. And here I am again—another cycle has started. This past weekend was the worst of my life. (Weekends seem to be the hardest for me now, and I feel like they will be the hardest part of the week from now on.) It started Friday with existential questions about life, and by Sunday, it got really weird. I wrote over 20 pages describing the phases I went through this weekend. I’ve already lost hope for my future. I used to have big dreams, but now, I don’t think I’m even allowed to dream because I’m trapped in this endless loop. Time is passing (this weekend felt like it crawled), yet I’m stuck in the same cycle, with no hope of finding a future where I can fit into this world. I’m starting to hate it. I despise society. It keeps pushing me out—or maybe I just don’t belong. I have so many questions and no answers. I used to believe that questions could be answers, but now, I’m not so sure. I don’t say good things to myself anymore. I’m starting to have chest pain, headaches, and jaw pain (I have an issue with my right jaw). I feel like I’m stuck on an infinite train, with the same things happening over and over. My body’s starting to hurt—it’s abandoning me. I guess the doubt is eating me from the inside out. My mind is racing, and my thoughts are faster than my hands can write. I’m tired. I’m exhausted. I see no future where I can have a family or find someone to love me. I used to be fit—I played tennis, handball, football, taekwondo—but now I’m losing everything. I’m not fit at all now. I’ve lost a part of my hair in the last few years. I have dark circles from lack of sleep, and my teeth are in terrible condition and hurting , I guess. I have so much more to say, but I’ll stop here for today… I’ll write down my feelings again tonight.",

    "Mania has passed. Hi everyone! I wanted to share that I had a manic episode yesterday and realized it while it was happening. This is the first time I have been able to recognize my mania in real time. I have experienced mania three times before, which has always led to psychosis and resulted in hospitalization or a visit to the ER for stronger medication. Fortunately, I stopped feeling manic last night. I reached out to a friend for support, and she advised me to do something relaxing. I followed her suggestion and listened to some soothing music, which made me feel sleepy. I went to bed at 10 pm and fell asleep quickly. Although I woke up around midnight and was concerned that I wouldn't be able to fall back asleep, I eventually did and slept through the rest of the night. I am incredibly relieved!",
    "The Tortured Artist Stereotype... what do you think?? Do you identify with it?. EDIT: \\*\\* Thank you to everyone for your insights! I personally dislike the tortured artist stereotype as I believe it creates almost a self-fulfilling prophecy where you feel that in order to create worthwhile art, you need to be suffering. As a teenager, I really identified with a lot of Sylvia Plath's own descriptions of mental illness (she is suspected to have had bipolar) and writing. As an adult though, I see how harmful it was to really let myself fall into that comfort, and I think it may have sometimes got in the way of treatment and getting myself help. \\*\\* I am wondering... does anyone else here consider themself a \"creative\"? Like, you spend your free time/have aspirations to be a writer, artist, etc? And with identifying as a creative, do you feel like the \"tortured artist\" stereotype fits your experience? Do you think the stereotype is harmful??? Or good? I'd really love to hear your opinions and thoughts on this. It's something that's been on my mind a lot recently.",

    "Friend called me autistic.. I have a friend who called me autistic. She knows I have bipolar, and sometimes I say things that are way too brutally honest and unfiltered and it hurts people. I can’t keep my thoughts to myself for some reason. I’m working on it though and I always apologize and I usually recognize it when it comes out of my mouth. Y’all have issues filtering what you say? I imagine it’s common with the racing thoughts and lack of self awareness when manic/hypomanic. I’ve been to a lot of doctors and none of them have said I’m on the spectrum, and the people who know me best have never called me “autistic”. I honestly think it’s offensive to autistic people to even say such a thing… I’m just insecure about it I guess. But it gives me a reason to be better at communication",

    "A psychiatrist didn’t believe me. Some backstory: I was diagnosed bipolar I by a private practice psychiatrist in May. Her practice does one diagnostic appointment, gives a recommendation to your family doctor and then discharges you. I lost my family doctor unexpectedly in July. The actual story: I made a virtual appointment with a public health service to change my medication because I just didn’t think they were working. I was matched with a nurse practitioner (who was legitimately very helpful). I explained my situation to her and she told me that she couldn’t find my diagnosis from my previous psychiatrist, likely because it was a private practice and this was a public clinic. She was able to find my medications and the notes from my old family doctor. She told me that this was out of her scope and said she would speak to a psychiatrist on staff and get back to me. When she called me back she said their psychiatrist did not think I could possibly have bipolar I because I’m married and have a job and bipolar I is only for people who are non-functional. So I was denied any change in my medication until I get diagnosed by a public health psychiatrist. Fortunately the NP did get me a referral to a rapid assessment clinic. I just feel really invalidated and upset that I’ve waited over a month to speak to anyone and now have to wait again with no real resolution in sight. I don’t need answers or anything I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has dealt with something like this.",

I know it takes like 4 to 6 weeks or maybe even longer for full effects. But I’ve been on 9 different medications now and I have felt like none of them did anything for me. And I also know that there’s so many medications I can try. But I’m just worried about side effects, especially ones involving anything to do with my weight. I’m taking the lowest dose possible right now due to my body size and whatever, but I feel like I need to ask for a higher dose and see how that works. I’m worried though about it making me sleepy which I know from experience is absolutely miserable to deal with when I have to work. I literally had to sleep in my car on every single break just so I could get through an eight hour shift. But that’s not an option anymore. This is just a vent post. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m just tired having to go through medication after medication and feeling hopeless about it.",

Which brings me to my main question is since I don’t know if I’m stable enough to have children (I’d like to have them, but am terrified of ruining their lives) and I’m constantly having these internal fights, I almost think I should leave my wife and let her have a chance at a more normal life with someone else.

    "Found an ADHD cleaning hack that has dramatically helped me. Wanted to share it here in case it helps others.. I, like many ADHD crew, struggle to stay on task and go down random rabbit holes. It’s up being double the efficiency for minimal result… if any result at all. SO - I realized the biggest issue is picking up a room and let’s say there are dishes I need to return to the kitchen. I do, but when I get to the kitchen I start doing something else that leads to something else… you all know the struggle. To remedy this, I went to our local dollar tree store and bought 5-6 plastic totes. Nothing huge. And of course one laundry hamper and a tall kitchen trash can. When I decide it’s time to tackle a room, I take the items listen above and each bin represents a room the item should belong in if it is not the room being clean. Dishes in the bedroom? They go in the kitchen basket. Lotion or hodgepodge over the counter meds that belong in our bathroom medicine cabinet? Bathroom basket. And so on. The prevents me from needing to leave the room while I’m putting it back together. When I’m done, I take one basket at a time to its designated room and put all of the things in The basket where they belong. And repeat the same process with each container. It’s really helped me stay on track (not perfection, but insanely better than anything else I’ve tried.",
    "Psychiatrist office forgot about me. Just a funny anecdote: I recently switched to an IRL psychiatrist for managing my ADHD and the office asked me to take something called the Conners test, which involved sitting in a tiny room clicking the spacebar on a keyboard in response to audio or visual stimuli. There was a button in the room that they told me to click when the test was complete. I finished and clicked the button but nothing happened. I considered that this _might_ be a 2nd stage to the test (which itself seemed to be designed to test patience/focus) and, not wating to seem incredibly impatient, I just waited... and waited... and waited. After about 20 minutes (and clicking the button twice more), I got up and opened the door. Turns out they'd forgotten about me, closed the office for the day, and gone home. The cleaning staff had to unlock the door to let me out. Lol. They were so apologetic. Also, I did terrible on the test and now am on Vyvanse.",

The medication gets me to a barely functional level... but I'm a hot mess of a train wreck, and I'm beginning to realize that I need to stop inflicting myself on others - maybe I just need to be alone. After all, the common factor in every one of my failed relationships is ME.",
    "Discovered a cleaning trick that worked. My house has been in shambles. I had no idea where to start and felt so defeated. So naturally I googled \"how to clean\" and found this advice. Pick a number, depending on your motivation level, energy level, time constraints, and the level of mess. Start counting what you pick up. The goal is to reach that number before taking a break. Do not do anything but pick up and count and put away I picked the number 300 and half hour later my lounge room is tidy and everything put away. I can't believe it worked. Wanted to share. It's not often I find something that helps",
    "why skip meds if you have a leisure day?. My older kid avoids my question, so maybe some of you have thoughts on this. When he goes to school or work he'll take his stimulants without any fuss, like a responsible young adult. But if it's a weekend or a day off, where he can just 'be', I'd say that 50% of the time he doesn't take them. I'd love to know why. Is there some common feeling/side effect of taking this medication that people like to avoid? Is there some downside to feeling like you have focus when you don't need it? Would love to hear some possible explanation.",

    "Is emotional dysregulation the most overlooked part of ADHD?. Seriously, in the popular discourse emotional dysregulation is so overlooked as being a part of ADHD and frankly I am not sure why that is.

    "First experience of medication and honestly wtf. So my doctors have started me on very low dosage to titrate up to 30mg of Methylphenidate (Ritalin/concerta for our brand name friends) and while I only took a 10mg dose about an hour ago I’m honestly shocked at the effect. I’ve finished my work tasks for the day, I went outside and I feel like I can see for the first time, if that makes sense, like I look at things and actually process information about it rather than just “see” it and be unable to process it because of everything else my brain was doing, I heard the birds for the first time over the sound of traffic outside my house, never paid attention to that. I asked myself “where did I put my Keys?” When leaving the house and… just remembered. I know it’s a low dose and definitely hasn’t got me back to 100% concentration but it’s taken the edge off and wow, I wasn’t expecting such a weirdly profound effect. Edit: just as I’ve had numerous people starting about the superman effect not lasting, the effects wane over time. I just want to say I know I stated the effect was profound but I don’t have increased focus, functional ability or bundles of energy. I’m feeling the effect because I have returned brain capacity from not over thinking, being anxious or depressed for the first time in 16 years. In fact yesterday all I wanted to do was sleep, I don’t feel like superman, I feel like I have a quiet head, that is all.",
    "As someone who has ADHD and is also on antidepressants, my short term memory is VERY bad. Here is the BEST strategy I’ve learned to combat it.. I forget everything. Literally. I forget what I’m doing while doing it, always forget what I’m supposed to do, plans or events I have to take care of, and the ONLY thing that has helped me that is quick and easy is using a number system. If I’m in the shower and remember that I need to call someone once I’m out, but then I also have to go pull the chicken out of the fridge, I think of, “2. Okay, 2 things” a few times in my head. Or if I don’t have time to write a list for the couple of things I need from the store I’ll think of the number of things that I need to grab, rather than the items first. Once I remember the number, for some reason it always links the actual task to it for me. Or if I’m shopping and I’m thinking to myself, “bread, eggs, milk. That’s everything, but didn’t I say I needed 4 things? Oh yeah, it was butter.” It’s really helpful when I don’t have my phone or a notepad on me. Just thought I’d share this tip for anyone interested 😊",
    "The Misrepresentation of ADHD on Social Media is Getting Out of Hand. If I'm being honest, I'm getting really \"annoyed\" with the constant flood of TikToks, Instagram posts, and YouTube shorts where people say, \"If you do this, you have ADHD.\" Like, ADHD is so much more complex than these generalized lists of symptoms. Everyone experiences it differently! Sure, you might relate to some behaviors they mention, but that doesn’t automatically mean you have ADHD. Sometimes, those behaviors are just normal parts of life or personality, not ADHD. The issue is, when you watch these videos, it can trick your brain into thinking, \"Oh yeah, I must have ADHD,\" which can actually make things feel worse for you. Suddenly, you’re convinced you have it, even though you might not. It’s so important to get properly tested if you think you might have ADHD rather than self-diagnosing based on what you see online. Don’t be like sum facebook mom would do or trust like Google is your doctor. If you really think you have it, take the steps to get a proper test. I have ADHD myself, and yeah, it’s different for everyone. I got tested and diagnosed, and it really annoys me to see people claiming they have it just because they’re \"hyperactive\" or something, without any actual diagnosis. Social media needs to chill with these blanket ADHD \"symptoms\" posts.",
    "My wallpaper on my phone changes everytime I unlock it and it has changed my life. I have a Samsung and you can set it so your wall paper can change to a different wallpaper everytime you lock/unlock your phone and it has changed my life. Let me explain. Im 36/m and I have ADHD. I learned about needing to be stimulated enough is a big deal. Especially for me when I'm underestimulated, I find myself getting into trouble. This may include me picking more fights with my wife(even though I can let it go) and when I'm at work and it's slow, I catch myself picking fights with certain customers(I work in the casino industry, it's normal lol) Aftet I set my phone for my wall paper to change everytime I unlock/lock it, I noticed I would take more time on looking at the photo and reminiscing it(of course these are my personal meaningful photos) and it puts me in a better mood. It totally changed my day. I've noticed how more uplifting I feel and more positively throughout the day. I highly recommend it to people who ADHD. Just give it a try.",

    "Help! ADHD Husband (Me) Set a (Figurative) Boundary and Wife Crossed It...Feeling Hurt Emotionally. Hi All, My wife and I had a verbal fight last night. The background on it is that I tried to be industrious/creative while my wife was away and I put \"padding\" on the cupboard doors to soften the loud noise they make when they close. My wife knows about my sensitivity to loud noises, as a sidenote. Innocent enough, right? Well, when she got home she saw what I had done, and started yelling and screaming at me since \"she didn't like it when I did things without her approval\". I know couples need to communicate, but it wasn't like I went out and bought a new car, or something like that... I told her (calmly) that I wanted to be proactive and creative and fix the problem on my own by doing it. She then proceeded to open and slam the cupboard doors, screaming that I 'knew she didn't like it when I drilled nails into the cabinets/cupboards'. In actuality, they were screws, which were no more than 1/2\" long, and on the **inside** of the cabinet. Now, the main issue...Our marriage has already been strained before this, the passion practically gone in recent times Many times, she only talks to me when she needs a favor, and I get lukewarm responses when I try to initiate anything romantic (and I'm not talking sexual...I mean like PG-rated marriage stuff). .Anyhow, soon thereafter, she kept yelling at me..then **she proceeded to call me 'stupid' and said the work I did on the cabinet looked 'ugly', 'just like me'.** At that point, I had had enough, and made a witty rejoinder. She stayed angry and ***wagged her finger right in my face***\\*\\*, which she has done before, despite me saying I did not want her to do it again.\\*\\* **Now I'm at the point of I must make a decision, since she crossed the boundary we made about no cruel insults and no physical 'fingers in the face' (literally).** Marriage counseling is for certain but I don't know if I'm wasting my time even doing that...Feedback is appreciated. :-)",

    "\"To be honest, I'm surprised that you didn't already know you have ADHD\". I sat down with my program director today to explain the unexpected leave of absence that I took. He was so patient and understanding, to the point in which I feel like he has some personal experience himself, and I feel so lucky and relieved. Then near the end he sheepishly told me as above that he was a little bit surprised that I wasn't aware I had ADHD. As someone who constantly doubts my own diagnosis, how validating! And how EMBARRASSING! I feel as if I had a piece of broccoli stuck in my front teeth for years and the people who did notice didn't bring it up until I did. Did multiple people just think I was weird all this time but never commented on it? :( Is it so obvious sometimes? I keep thinking that ruining my own reputation could have been avoided if I'd been diagnosed and medicated earlier. Oh well.",

I had shown him my 2nd grade report card (among others) which said, 1st Q of school, mind you, \" *my name* is a daydreamer most of the time. She could get her work correct if she got down to business.\" The whole diagnostic process was fascinating, unnerving, slightly embarrassing, and mostly affirming. I feel so much compassion for myself. The psychiatrist was great. I did interrupt him a few times, including finishing his sentence about finishing people's sentences (ha!).

    "What are some \"simplify your life/saving enery\" tips that have worked for you? (e.g. buying only the same pair of socks). Besides ADHD I have autism and physical health problems, which mean that I have very low energy to spend and I have to save it otherwise I get in further pain + worse memory problems. I believe that the socks example is a very good one because you save money by not having to buy a new pair every time you lose one sock, safe the time to look for the missing sock and time to organize all socks together.I have also cut my hair short, minimized my number of belonging, etc. What are your best tips(or...all of them?)?",

    "For my fellow physically hyperactive people… a word from my therapist. Wanted to share for those who have similar experiences and feelings as I do. I (25f) have fairly severe combined ADHD and am pretty hyperactive. As in I can’t stay still. I’m the person who is constantly pacing, rocking, foot tapping, nail biting, etc. Etc. A lot of times that has been fairly embarrassing because I’ll get looked at, Stared at, watched, I’ve been told i can make people anxious or think I’m being rude because I just can’t. Stay. Still. Think waiting in line at the pharmacy and I’m tapping my foot or swaying as if I’m being impatient when I’m not Intending to in any way, shape, or form. I discussed this with my therapist today and she reminded me that ADHD is a neurological disorder. Just like people with Parkinson’s who get tremors or people who have verbal ticks, those with ADHD and physical hyperactivity, you can’t help your movements. You can do things to try to minimize them, but you can’t help how your brain functions and your ADHD presents. All that to say - you can’t help who you are so don’t feel bad or embarrassed for needing to move and not being able to just be still.",

    "Anyone thought they had ADHD and turned out to be depression?. Apologies if this isn’t necessarily the right space to post and is also somewhat niche, but just wanted to ask the question. I went to my doctor early August and expressed concerns about mental health after reaching a limit. Long story short, he said i have many traits which suggest anxiety and depression. I had earlier said that amongst the two i do believe i have ADHD too which he said he believed I didn’t. Having done some reading myself, I’ve found that there is actually quite a bit of crossover between depression and ADHD. I was wondering if anyone has found their believed ADHD symptoms reduce/stop when they’ve treated themselves for depression? My “ADHD symptoms” (in quotes as i am not diagnosed with it as of now) include: •intense procrastination, not being able to focus no matter what i do, change, restrict, limit etc •massive memory struggles (often having to reread text several times after reading it, not being able to remember what someone has said in a conversation at times, particularly in person) •in my head I’m yelling at myself to get up and be active and do stuff but I physically cannot get myself to do anything and i just laze around •bad time management, in the sense that I’ll rarely do a task but it actually takes much longer than I convince myself it will. And more but I hope you get the gist. I feel like depression is exacerbating a lot of it, and I know that ADHD in itself (if i have it) is it’s own condition which requires it’s own line of treatment, but i wonder if treating my depression would lessen/stop these symptoms and others. Any insight would be appreciated :)",

On Amazon, I found these [Plastic Zipper Pouches](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=plastic+zip+bags+office) that come in all sorts of colours and sizes. They're quite sturdy and you can write on them with sharpies. My son didn't need so many, and they come in this big pack. I had quite a few left over and I hate waste so I started using them myself. First for stuff in my home office like pens and paper clips... And then stuff in my the bathroom like hair and skin care products... And then stuff from the living room like unused batteries... And bit by bit, *everything that makes a mess* in my home, office, or garage got packed into a bag. With it's own label and colour. This was the gamechanger for me. * When I'm searching for something, I can see into every bag. I don't need to rummage to find it so I'm not pulling everything apart. * When I take it out, instead of upsetting a whole shelf or digging down into the bottom of a box, it's just this one specific bag. * It's easier to repack one little bag than one big box. I can put small bags inside of big bags for grouping. * Arranging the bags on my shelves and in drawers or boxes in order of colour is just so satisfying that I've somewhat 'gamified' putting things back for myself.

I read ALOT of reddit posts (marriage counselors should just roam reddit for new clients). Eventually, at about 330am, i felt like it was a good time to sleep (i didn't feel tired, i was just like \"maybe it'll work this time?\"). Was I tired? Hell no! But i slept till 7am anyways. Still not tired! Pretty much the rest of the morning was fine! But it was like a switch flipped at noon and i turned into a drooling zombie. There wasnt much that happened that afternoon. I just layed on the couch, exhausted but unable to sleep. It was still summer so my 6 year old NEEDED to tell me about the amazing youtube video he watched (what a great time for his ADHD to kick in right?). As my son would put it, 0 out of 10, do not reccomend.",
    "I'm starting to notice that people dont really accept adhd when they have to deal with one. As someone with ADHD, I summarize my life like this: \"most people say they have accepted you until they see your difficulties and then run away.\" They make me feel so at fault, especially when they know something has happened or changed in the \"connection \" with the other person but never say anything. They want me to guess what's wrong, but I have a thousand thoughts in my head, and out of all the things, only the person involved can tell me what the problem is. Have you ever had experiences like this?",

    "My biggest fear would be that I don't have ADHD. I'm not diagnosed with ADHD. Not officially. It's been 8 months now since I bought this book on ADHD (written by the mini ADHD coach on Instagram, if you're familiar), because I had some questions. Since then, I've become almost convinced that I have this condition. Many childhood memories have resurfaced as 'signs' of it, as well as certain behaviors I used to have. But the thing is, I'm not 'officially' ADHD. I don't have the little stamp on my head that makes people accept me as I am. My biggest fear is that I don't actually have ADHD, and that I've been the problem from the start—that it's my fault if I'm bad at things, if I'm socially awkward, and if I can't do what everyone else does. And my personal conspiracy theory is that maybe my brain started adopting ADHD behaviors after I learned about it. Double conspiracy theory: I'm saying this just to reassure myself. Need your opinion on this",
    "Your favourite ADHD analogies, I’ll go first!. I’ve recently become obsessed with relating to analogies and trying to find analogies for my pals without ADHD. This is how I recently explained ADHD paralysis: “It’s like you’re sitting in the car, waiting for the lights to go green. You technically could just cross the red lights, but that’s dangerous and against the law. So you wait. You can sometimes see the light turn to yellow, but then it just turns back to red. Then at one point, all of a sudden that light turns green and you’re able to drive. You’re then either able to drive for quite some time since you’re on a decent road or you get then just stuck behind another set of traffic lights again”. What are some analogies that you’ve heard or came up with?",
    "I was told that there are different tests for ADHD because I’m trans. Is this true?. I’m an adult and wanted to get tested for ADHD. I found someone who does it and got signed up. I had to wait almost a month for the appointment and then the evening before the appointment she emailed me and said that she couldn’t do it because I was transgender and the test she gave was for normative people. Before I get really upset I just wanted to see if anyone else had ever heard of this or is the woman just being mean? Thanks. Edit: Thank you to everyone who has commented. I didn’t think it was a valid reason and she was just being transphobic. I have no experience with this. It didn’t feel right though. I’m glad that it happened though because I feel like I dodged a bullet and wouldn’t have gotten a good diagnosis with her. I have found someone else to test me that flat out said gender identity has nothing to do with diagnosing ADHD. I’ll be seeing him in a few weeks.",
    "I'm just not cut out for life. I don't know why I'm even posting this here because I'm not expecting any help. I don't think I can be helped at this point. I suppose I just need to vent. Therapy is too expensive. Screenings are too expensive. Self-help methods don't work. So now what? I'm supposed to just be like this forever? Just constantly underperforming, sliding deeper and deeper into poverty and despair because I can't even maintain focus long enough to help myself? If this is what life is going to be like then I don't see myself living much longer. I refuse to do this. At times it feels like to only way to silence my brain is to take a knife to it, to stab it so deep into my eyes that it pierces my brain so that it can bring me some modicum of relief. I don't even know if this is ADHD. Maybe I'm just insane. Too bad I'll never figure it out since poor people apparently aren't worthy of mental health treatment. What my life could've been if I had been born with a normal brain. What I could've achieved if I could actually pursue my goals without getting in the way of myself. Sylvia Plath described her life like a fig tree, each branch a path to a life that could be were it not for her indecisiveness, as she sat at the roots starving. Never have I related more to a quote. If you read this far I'm sorry. I'll shut up now and forever. Edit: Thank you all for the comments. I didn't expect that they would actually make me feel better, but reading from those of y'all who either empathize or offer guidance helped me get through the day. I think I'll start writing my thoughts down more, even if I never share any of them again, since I did feel better after having vented my frustrations.",
    "i learned that my IR adderall wasn't doing it's job right from this sub. it was weird, first of all. when i first started it, it was going okay! when it ran out for me, i felt like i crashed and burned a bit but got used to it. after being on instant release for almost two years, i realised that it was supposed to make your brain quiet. like, actually quiet. it unjumbled my thoughts, but it just made them an organized, forever busy high speed one lane highway. I'd go through hundreds of thoughts, and then a car wreck would happen (a bad thought, something not even real/an unlikely scenario/etc) and then my brain would hyperfixate on that wreck and then my mood would be ruined and I'd ruminate on it all day til i forgot it altogether. this was, apparently, not normal. talked to my shrink, asked about extended release. he said it might help, let's try it and see. my god. it's like day and night. it's quiet if i want it to be quiet. if i feel myself fixating on something, i just go \"hey, stop that\" and it stops. i can drive so good now, too. i have depth perception. i have peripheral vision. i feel like an actual fuckin person. i have control over my emotions too. things that would throw me into a fit of anger or sadness don't anymore, because i can actually LET IT GO. anyway, psa, if this sounds like you, i suggest experimenting if you can. it's a game changer",
    "I get irrationally upset when disturbed during hyperfocus. For my whole life, I have very much struggled starting and staying focused on anything im not interested in, whether that be chores, assignments, work etc. Whenever I do manage to get into a focused zone, I find that if anyone interrupts me or asks me to do something else for a second I get so bothered. Maybe because its so difficult to get back to being focused afterwards. It usually hasnt been a problem but after being in a longterm relationship its starting to create tension. Im studying full time right now and have the classic ADHD struggle of last minuting every assignment (even with medication and various techniques to try complete tasks early) and I find that I spend a good 24 hours before a due date hyperfocusing on an assignment. Sadly, this means almost any interaction I have with my partner during that time bothers me, as it distracts me and makes it difficult to focus again. Obviously this is terrible and my partner doesnt deserve that (nor the stress of watching me last minute everything), especially because sometimes due dates align with other important things. If anyone has advice on not being so annoyed or just time management techniques that have worked for them I would love to hear your opinion. Feel like I've tried everything 😭",
    "What do you do (specifically) in the first few minutes or so *immediately* after waking up?. I struggle hard with the first few minutes immediately after waking up. My brain floods with all the possible morning tasks I could do — brush teeth, shower, yoga, meditate, get some sunlight, stretch, eat, make tea — and in that moment of overwhelm, I freeze, and can’t get my body to choose something to start with unless I force it. More often than not, anxiety creeps in during the freeze state, or perhaps causes it, or whatever, and I end up sleeping in until the last possible moment, unable to do any of these things that would be good for me. What do YOU prioritize in the first immediate moments after waking up? Perhaps a ritual, rather than a task like the ones I mentioned? If it’s not automatic for you to do it right after waking up, how do you get yourself out of the brain fog and into initiating that first step?

My doctor told me I need to come in every 3 months for a check-in in order for her to continue writing my prescriptions. I guess it’s a controlled substance, and it’s protocol? But I’ve been on and off ADHD meds my whole life - I’ve started taking it very regularly again the past few months, as previously it was a lot of inconsistent usage (though I still got my prescriptions filled frequently) - and never remember hearing of this requirement until recently, and haven’t had to do it before from my memory, but then again, shockingly, my memory isn’t great, cuz of, ya know, the ADHD… I’m worried my insurance might be an ass about that many visits. Does everyone need to do the visits this often for their prescriptions? And if not, how else do you get the meds? Thanks! (I take Vyvanse - 50mg, btw)",

I work in a small bakery by myself in a little country town and today I had a woman come in and straight away started chatting excitedly because we both had septum piercings and tattoo sleeves. The way she was talking and how she had gotten hers a week ago like I did then impulsively got a new tattoo same day, I paused and asked “adhd?” She does indeed have it so we got more excited chatting away and honest to god it was like talking to a carbon copy of myself! After she left I went out back and cried a little. It was so overwhelming now knowing I’m not alone, I’m not insane and there’s people out there that get me and understand me and accept me and think I’m amazing because I understand and celebrate them too.

    "Libido on adderall. Hi, I (19F) started taking adderall about 2 months ago. My libido has been crazy high this last week. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a way to combat this or does it just go away after time? Before I had trouble getting in the mood because I was on lexapro, but now I’m literally horny 24/7. Doesn’t matter how many times I get off, it just comes back. Any advice is appreciated. NEW INFO: I talked to my mom and she’s been having issues down there too weirdly enough. They started at the same time as mine, although she said hers more feels like a UTI (it’s not) but a little different. Weird coincidence. Our laundry crystals did change over the weekend when it started tho! That could be causing it she thinks? Edit: I feel like maybe my explanation was a bit wrong. I’m not just horny 24/7, I’m in a state of arousal with no cause. I’m not seeing a hot guy and feeling horny, it’s more just I wake up or it happens when I’m doing homework, on my phone, eating, etc. it doesn’t really go away fully, maybe fades some.

I use those and set it to lock after 24 hours (they do need to verify the # works so don't lock it right away). note to add, incoming charges are NOT forwarded to your credit card, they are just declined. This is different from when your actual CC expires and they send you a new card with a new number. Recurring payments using your real CC# (such as a utility bill) will often get forwarded to your new number without your needing to update them. **This hack may not last forever**, as it's kind of in an ethically grey area. ENO is meant to discourage CC fraud, not as a way to avoid subscription costs. But then again, these companies are relying on us to forget the trial deadline so perhaps it evens the score.\" * u/Canuck_Voyageur: \"This also **works with Amazon prime, and Amazon subsidiary subscriptions**.

    "Do you ever feel like you don’t know the things you know?. It’s hard to explain this, but do you ever feel like you’re entirely unable to recall and/or explain things that you actually know? Even if it’s something you know well or are supposed to. Could be very basic, elementary things or more complex work-related. Is this even connected to ADHD or it a completely different malfunction my brain has? :D",
    "Is ADHD known to affect math skills?. I have trouble remembering how to do most math and when doing it tend to be slow. I don’t want to get moved down a class, so should I inform my teacher that I struggle with ADHD? I can never really pay attention when it comes to math. Is this because I stuck at math or can I partly blame my ADHD?",
    "Have you also lost your cravings for alcohol after starting medication?. It's Friday, and that's usually the day I get huge cravings for red wine or something. 90% of the time, I end up finishing the bottle and having a terrible Saturday. But now, it's strange, I simply don't want alcohol. I just want to go out and party sober with friends. Am I the only one feeling like this?",
    "I never realised I couldn't enjoy movies because of my ADHD. I thought I didn't.like movies because they bored me. Apparently it's because I can't focus for that long. It's been an eye opener with this diagnosis because I now understand why there were so many things I struggled to do. Tidying was the main one! I was the most unorganized person before because I just couldn't figure out how to complete the tasks. It's crazy how debilitating ADHD actually is. When I was a kid, we were literally told \"having ADHD isn't an excuse for.your anger issues\". Wow how times have changed (thankfully).",
    "My current therapy sessions are awful. I dread going there because every. Single. God damn week it's the same thing...I go to my appointment, my psychologist asks me what happened during the last week, and that's where the problems begin. I never have anything to say. I always procrastinate until my next session when I could have done something, anything at all, to improve my situation. Then awkward silence, while he's just perplexed at how I have zero motivation to do anything at all. All the sessions are just him saying \"You gotta do it\" and \"It seems to me that you think at some point magically everything will be fine\", and he's right. It hurts so fucking much. I just have to act, but no, I'd rather be a passive b\\*tch and continue this unhealthy behavior. Keep playing video games all day when I shouldn't, look to find ways to separate myself from my mother because we have an unhealthy, and symbiotic relationship, but I don't. I'm a failure as a human being. I know it's my responsibility. I should take better care of myself, but yeah. I don't know anymore...",
    "What strategies do you employ not to get bored in romantic relationships?. Every relationship I’ve (32F) been in, I’ve gotten bored with. I understand why this is. It is me and my ADHD/ needing constant stimulation. I have had two beyond amazing partners, gotten bored. Another partner who I did not get bored with it was because it was a stimulating relationship in the sense that it was toxic. We were always fighting, unstable, and not a relationship to go to marriage for. All other partners I’ve dated, I’ve also gotten bored with. People say “when you meet the right person, you will know”. Two of my relationship have been the right person but my mind craves that stimulation/ excitement/ toxicity almost. So what do you do when you find yourself getting bored with partners? We surely can’t just keep bouncing around chasing that honeymoon period.",
    "Was severely addicted to junk food, turns out i was just rebelling against myself. Yeah ik absurd. Have tried millions methods to lose the addiction, moderation, cold turkey, once a week only. Yadda yadda. I mean basically everything. Recently was reading something up and i realised the fact that i reach out for junk food even when i don’t want to eat it and am already super full is simply because i tell myself no more junk food today. The moment i do that i want it so badly, it resulted in hours of fighting with myself to not order it but i ended up order and followed by guilt and repeat. So i tried a new method, i decided to let myself have at it. So if my brain says “i want junk food” i legit went “okay go on have it” the key here is to really mean the go on have it. Guess what? The strong craving melted away! I was stunned. So now it’s almost two weeks now and i have been eating in deficit :) It’s so weird that i was rebelling against myself lmao",
    "Could it make sense that it is ADHD that makes me love hotel rooms for their simplicity?. Before you assume - I do not mean the fact that most people likely like staying in hotel rooms since it usually means holiday, vacation, time off work, new adventures, new countries, luxury(?), or something. However, I mean specifically liking hotel rooms also over AirBNBs, even the fancy kind. I've been thinking WHY I like hotel room so much and why I'm happy in them and then it dawned on me. They are small, clean, clear, organized, and LIMITED. You have a tiny little place to sleep, you have a little place to shower, a little place to sit and put your clothes and that's it. I don't mean an executive suite but a basic $80 queen room or whatever. If I'm staying at hotel rooms I don't have a whole lot of things with me typically and there are no distractions.",
    "Partner brings up the ADHD divorce rate when I express my frustrations. My partner isn’t medicated since neither of our jobs provide healthcare. It’s inconvenient but we figured we’d stick it out until I can get a better job. However, recently his memory and time management is getting worse. I knew it was going to happen but I’m still struggling to deal with it. The main struggle I have right now is that I work at a car wash 5-6 days a week and he works from home 8:30-5:30 Monday- Friday. Two weeks ago I had cleaned almost all of the dishes before bed. He said that he would complete the rest the next day. Unfortunately he didn’t. No biggie, I finished them when I got home from work. On Saturday he said that he’ll do the dishes, a few days passed and he still hasn’t done them. He said he was sorry and that time got away from him and I responded that “it’s sucks but it’s okay”. He then said to me “if it sucks so much, why don’t you do them?” I responded with that I do them, I have to do them every time. I’ll have to do them tomorrow on my only day off this week. I disengaged from the conversation after this. A while later, we somehow got into a tiff again about the dishes and I was expressing my frustrations that I want to sit around on my two days off like he does but I can’t because of the chores and that it feels like all of the responsibilities fall onto me. After I said that he brought up the statistic that that divorce rate for couples with a spouse that has ADHD is 66%. I can’t tell if that’s his way of making me back down or trying to justify his actions. I don’t know. I’ve been trying to read up on how to live with someone with ADHD but it seems that it can only get better if we’re both trying. I want to help him but over helping hurts him in the long run and I’m not sure if he’s really trying anymore. I don’t know what to do.",
    "Four years after diagnosis, I am being denied access to meds. The cherry is top? I am three weeks into a PhD program.. I was diagnosed with ADHD 4 years ago after a lifetime of struggling with academics, organization, etc. Before diagnosis, I was a nurse aide with an erratic academic record. After diagnosis, I began pursuing my dream of becoming a psychologist. It was an uphill battle, but after three application cycles, I was finally admitted to a PhD program. I am thankful every day for access to treatments that made this possible. Today, the student clinic notified me that my ADHD diagnosis does not meet their strict criteria, and I will not be prescribed meds until I complete a full neuropsych eval. Assessment is booked out through January. My original dx did not include a neuropsych eval, but I was diagnosed by a local psychologist, not a pill mill app. I was tested as a child but not diagnosed - I suspect due to my gender (female), ADHD type (inattentive), competitiveness (overwhelming my inattentiveness), and high IQ (I hate to bring this up but it can skew ADHD testing results and my IQ is not just above average, it is high). I am also now \"successful\" despite the significant struggles I had before dx. All of this makes me concerned that I will end up losing access to meds all together. For most of my life I was seen by myself and others as unintelligent, inept, and lazy. It took me seven years to finish undergrad and I spent most of my adult life in minimum wage jobs because I couldn't get my shit together. I am terrified of regressing. I want this degree more than anything I have ever wanted and to think that this fucking condition that I thought I had finally surmounted might prevent me from achieving the goals I have worked so hard for makes me sick. This is partly a rant and partly reaching out in search of similar experiences. Anyone get assessed as a child and not diagnosed, then assessed as an adult and was diagnosed? Anyone else with a high IQ who went through testing as an adult? I am so afraid.",
    "\"Sorry- I heard every word, but have no clue what you just said.\". I've always had a bad habit of nodding along as if I'm \"engaged\" in conversation, only to contribute with a totally irrelevant response because I wandered off halfway through. People have always playfully given me shit because someone will ask me something like, \"how's your day going?\" and I'll reply with \"yeah, I do\" or something dumb like that. It is funny, and I joke about it too, but that's always been a frustrating thing for me and my ADHD. I feel bad because I really do just tune out if I'm not stimulated by the topic. It feels involuntary, and It's not even that I'm not listening, because I do hear the words being said. I can follow along until my thoughts wander to a point of no return, then I catch it and try to circle back in, but usually by this point I've missed too much of the conversation to engage any further, and would be better off just silently walking away instead of acting like I know what the hell the other person said and saying something stupid. And it's not like I can tell people like, \"sorry man, I'm not stimulated enough at the moment so I stopped listening and started day-dreaming about things that will literally never happen instead.\" I don't know if any of this is relatable or made sense, it's tough to explain and I feel like I look like an asshole every time I try, but still... I tried.",
    "Why do I CONSISTENTLY push deadlines to a crisis point?. I post this here because I figure maybe someone in this sub might relate. At least every few months, I get myself so backed up with work and even personal projects that it becomes a legit crisis. It's almost like I CAN'T get started on the task at hand until it's past due, until I'm in danger of letting someone down, until I'm having active panic over it. It's almost like I'm BEGGING someone to tell me I'm a disappointment, or worthless, or untalented. It's a familiar place I put myself in, and I do it again and again even though it is intensely painful there. I know you can't diagnose my problem from one short paragraph, but, like, is it just me?",
    "How to keep my ADHD husband interested and focused during sex?. Sex has been very frustrating. It could be smells, too much talking, my pubic hair being a bit too long and then suddenly his erection goes. I really like to communicate during sex so that I know he is comfortable but then I end up talking too much and he gets turned off. We haven’t been able to actually have intercourse yet because he hasn’t been able to be hard enough for that. It’s hard because I end up feeling very rejected and I use to initiate sex and now I don’t want to at all because we end up stopping and feeling frustrated. He keeps being optimistic saying we’re just learning but how he needs things to be seems so specific and new everytime…I just want to give up. Any advice? His sex drive is very low too which doesn’t help… Overall I feel so undesirable and disconnected. Edit: Thank you all for the tips! Just to reply at once to some questions here: -Yes we waited until marriage &amp; have been married for a few weeks and we still wouldn’t change that despite current difficulties - absolutely love our married life regardless! -He is not on any medication. -Getting him turned on is very easy and can happen frequently throughout the day- maintaining the erection is the issue. What doesn’t help either is that his head is VERY sensitive. Like it needs to be under the foreskin most of the time for him to be comfortable which really doesn’t help with his sensory issues… Some of the tips here are great and will definitely try some of them!",

    "ADHD tax rant. I hate thinking I've \"got it\" and falling on my face.. I AM MAD. Sorry for yelling, and I know you understand, but sometimes it really hurts when I get the ADHD tax bill and it's huge - when I've ignorantly been thinking I'm doing good and staying proactive. I planned ahead and ordered a spare tarp, except I didn't put it on, and had 30 gallons of water spill through a hole in my roof a few days ago. $300 from savings and still drying my stuff out. I planned ahead and asked for someone to watch my kids so I wouldn't have to miss work today. I missed the text message saying \"yes\" and ended up leaving work early thinking I needed to pick them up. $100 from next week's paycheck gone. I planned ahead and bought extra groceries for the month, left them on the counter all night. $150 in meat, cheeses, etc gone. I planned ahead.... You get it. And this week the tax was because I thought I planned ahead, but the joke was on me. In total all my ADHD taxes this week cost me $825+ ( a huge part of my *monthly* budget ). I'm mad. Let's try again next week, and go back to the basics. Best of luck and thanks for the community to listen to my vent."

    "I Survived a Genocide But I Feel Nothing. I managed to evacuate from Gaza, leaving behind the rubble, the bodies, and the memories of the war zone. You’d think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety—but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I’d be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing. I’m in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things—traffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I’m expected to care about small talk? I don’t. Even after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I’m telling someone else’s story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I’m reading from a script. I can’tonnect to it anymore. It’s like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble. I’ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn’t register. I didn’t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn’t make it out. I didn’t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it’s just blank. People think escaping the genocide means survival, but it’s not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what’s still happening, or hear about others’ struggles, I can’t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop. I’m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I’m functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I’m just as destroyed as the streets I left behind. It’s been 5 months",
    "Why do men hate women so much?. I just came off of Facebook after reading a news article about how women apparently save their money better than men. I just want to say majority of those comments are men just shitting on women. Of course there are some Andrew Tate gifs in there, some accusations of taking everything during a divorce. It’s quite concerning to read and the media is just fuelling the hate. So many men in our society actually just hate women. How did it get like this??. It’s really lowered my faith in humanity and most importantly men. I just want to say this to all of my lovely lady/trans friends. Please, please be careful out there.",
    "I hate drunk people so much. I can’t stand being around them. The way they slur their words, their incoherent blabber, the touchiness - it all makes me sick. I’ve had way too many uncomfortable encounters with drunks. And every single time I’ve felt so helpless. One particular encounter from when I was a little kid has stuck with me throughout the years. A *clearly* drunk family friend walked into the bathroom with me (unannounced, unwarranted), locked the door and started acting really, really weird. They kept on saying “it’s fine”, touching my hair, complimenting me with a bated breath.. Seriously, where is their shame? When I move out I swear I’ll have a breathalyzer attached to my front door. 0.00 or you’re off on your merry way",

You don’t need to prove your worth to enjoy a peaceful moment, a good meal, or the things that make you smile.💖",

My boyfriend shot himself in the head right next to me &amp; basically died in front of me while I was trying to save him. Ive kind of been suppressing everything, sometimes i break &amp; feel like im going crazy without him but most days i keep everything in for the sake of my baby. I don’t want to stress myself out by crying or overthinking. I’m afraid I won’t be so strong after I give birth. I want to see a therapist now but I just feel like it wouldn’t help. I want to see a psychiatrist after for antidepressants or some type of meds because I just replay that whole night in my head. I know I can wait for my baby to get here but after idk how much longer I can act like im okay. It’s eating me alive.

When I drink, I want to talk to people When I drink, I have energy and motivation When I drink, I’m not depressed When I drink, I actually want to do things Is it because I’m low on dopamine?

I did get diagnosed as a kid but never treated I have constant brain fog, hardly leave my bed, have no desire to do anything Got my bloodwork done and everything was normal, waiting for my vitamin D test though as I hardly go outside.

If you are struggling with self harm, i want you to know the first 6 months were the hardest for me, after that it starts to feel more bearable.

I mean yeah it may be normal, but the thing that doesn’t leave me alone now is: WHO? like he hasn’t a lot of female friends (he hasn’t that much friends at all) and most of the female ppl he knows, I know too. So I can’t stop thinking about who he could have thought about sexually and it drives me fcking insane. I’m open for advice :)",

Then, she said guys don’t like Indian girls (she isn’t Indian, I am). Then she said they don’t like conventionally ugly girls. Why would she say that to me? We were getting along fine before why would she feel the need to be so rude to me for no reason?

Is it at all possible she wasn’t calling me ugly?",

I’m sure there are people who’ve been dealing with these things for far longer than that. It’s only gotten worse as I’ve gotten older and what am I supposed to do? Just live for another 50 years hating life? I don’t have anything to look forward to, I don’t have any hobbies that I enjoy, or any significant other to be with. I’m sick and tired of feeling like this every day. I figure I’ll have to outlive my mom and then there’s my cats, so once they’re all gone (maybe 15-20 years) I’ll be able to go too.

Wanting attention doesn’t make you needy or less worthy—it makes you human. Don’t be ashamed of your need to be acknowledged. You deserve to be seen and cherished for who you are. 💛",
    "What has helped with your mental health the most? (Don't say therapy/meds... what else?). Therapy is expensive, and finding a good therapist is hard. Seeing a psychiatrist is expensive, the diagnosis might be inaccurate, and finding the right medication usually requires time-consuming titration and one might experience possible side effects. Basically, working with a mental health professional is costly and takes a LOT of patience... at least from personal experience: over 9 years, I've seen 6 therapists, 2 psychiatrists, received 3 different diagnosis and am regularly on meds - they do seem to help! However, in 2 recent depressive episodes, I noticed that having a regular exercise regime has helped my mood significantly: I'd do HIIT classes 3-4x a week, and a weekly hike. Getting daily sunlight (or blue light) has also helped. No change in meds. I've read that various supplements (magnesium, fish oil, vit Bs), diets (Mediterranean, keto) and types of exercise (weightlifting?) can help... but tbh it's all pretty overwhelming to figure out. I'm curious to know, besides therapy and meds, what has helped with your mental health recovery most? How did you keep track and notice the difference its made?",

I've been trying to get him to open up about his feelings and past. Last night he shared with me that he was afraid to talk growing up. I pushed him further and asked why. And he said he was afraid of being punished. When I asked why he was afraid he would be punished if he talked he got very defensive and mad. Then he told me he can't remember anything from when he was 14 and part of 15. I feel like he had some unresolved trauma but maybe some teenagers just have missing gaps of memory?

Sometimes it’s making fun of someone doing something embarrassing but then usually there’s some sympathy in the comments saying that it’s not fair to be laughing at this person. But sometimes it is a video of a person doing something wrong and then the general consensus seems to be that they deserve to be shamed. well ok. So maybe they deserve punishment but don’t you think that posting videos like this online is like lynching? I just saw a video of a woman screaming racist things on a train but it was pretty obvious that she was mentally ill. she was talking to people who weren’t there. I think recording this and putting it online is a form of abuse. We don’t know what’s this person’s problem. we don’t have a back story. But we really like to vilify others and feel self-righteous. and even if she was truly just racist, still what’s the point of putting this online? two wrongs don’t make a right. Personally, I think that the internet is really doing a lot of harm to modern society. I think it would be much better to walk up to a person causing the nuisance and explain that they are bothering others. But instead people stay away and take out their phones to ridicule them online.",
    "is scratching considered selfharm?. whenever i am angry, disappointed and/or anxious, i always find myself scratching my arms/thighs till it burns and punching my head several times; the latter happens so much the pain doesn't even last anymore. Is this considered SH? I've always associated selfharm with cutting, and while i know it's not the only way to hurt yourself, the things i said above don't seem as bad (as cutting) to me, so i am having trouble knowing if what i am doing is still considered sh",
    "I just turned into a rage monster and I don’t know what happened.. I don’t know what just happened. It’s all a blur. Something like a switch in me went off. I got super overwhelmed and mad about something I don’t even know. No one was pissing me off. My son, 6yo, was screaming cause his game or a snack I don’t remember. And baby was crying. Maybe that was it. I remember my husband telling me to take a breather and calm down and asking me why I’m mad and I snapped and was all “IM NOT MAD BUT IM GETTING MAD CAUSE YOU KEEP TELLING ME IM MAD”. I went in the kitchen to get water for a bottle and he stopped what he was doing and was silent cause ya know, I just bit his head off for no reason. And I remember saying “you hate me that much you won’t talk to me hey” I don’t know why I even said that. Right when I said it I felt really bad. But now I’m upstairs putting baby down for a nap. And he came upstairs and was all “I’m going for a drive to cool down. You’re the person I love the most in this world and you think I hate you I would never hate you” and now I feel SO BAD it’s eating me alive and I really don’t know what came over me. Is this normal? It’s never happened before. I usually feel myself getting angry or upset or overwhelmed etc. But this time I didn’t know. It’s all a blur.",
    "I would've died in that house. Today I broke down on my boyfriend. I recently put two and two together that my chronic back problems that have already put me in the hospital 3 times, are mostly caused by the years of abuse I endured as a child and teen, being forced into hard labour for up to 12 hours a day. It's really hard to face. That I went through so much suffering waiting for freedom, and now that I have it, the abuse is still effecting my quality of life. I really broke down, and ended up having a really beautiful moment with the man I love. When I'm like that, it's very clear that it hurts him. He holds me so tight, it's like he's trying to hold me together. Just repeating \"I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. You're okay. I love you\". I told him, no matter what happens between us, or how much times passes, I'll never be able to not love you. I would've died in that house. Because I would have. For so so many years, I dreamed of someone coming to save me. I dreamed of someone that could love me. And I never thought it would actually happen but if he hadn't cared for me, more time would've passed, and I would've eventually given in. 20 years was long enough. He saved my life.",
    "it's okay to like \"girly\" things as a boy?. okay this may sound very dumb, i struggle with a lot of things and one of them is this. for a little more context, i'm 15 and trans (i talk about that part with my psychologist too, nothing more to deepen the subject because i suffer from anxiety and this leads to a lot of insecurities about it) and i like things that i find cute or aesthetically pleasing. i live in a place where roles and stereotypes are very marked, where if you don't fit the traditional standard, you are made fun of or people think you're a weirdo. i think that's where my conflict with this comes from, having an \"alternative\" style or \"niche\" tastes. i don't even like extremely feminine things, but I'm very hard on myself. i just want to be a person who enjoys the things i like without any problems. this affects me in many ways but I'm too lazy to talk about that right now. i would like to hear other people's opinions, men too, but anyone is welcome! EDIT: this was my first time posting in reddit, i'm used to seeing hostility and radical people on the internet so seeing people being nice to me, it really made me shed a few tears. it was very calming to read the responses and i wanted to thank you all. i would love to thank each and every one of you, as a loving person that I am, but I am very socially awkward, and english is not my first language! i can't wait to grow up and be able to buy the things i love so much!",

Job market is shit, I haven't been able to see my therapist for 5 weeks now, I been beaten down so much just in every aspect of life, I just don't want to struggle for no reason so I figured oh well why not give up.",
    "I see myself so ugly I can't stop. I am 23M. All my life I have felt like an ugly person, my body, face, everything. I don't know what it is to feel good about my physique, this has caused me serious problems with self-esteem, insecurity and an inferiority complex. I feel like everyone who sees me sees me as a super horrible person, I feel like I can't be attractive to anyone. When someone compliments me on my looks I feel like they are lying to me and I feel bad. I can't even joke about it because I feel a voice in my head telling me that I am pathetic. I feel uncomfortable with whatever clothes I have, or any haircut o anything. I don't feel comfortable with anything. I know that all of these are just thoughts, I know that objectively I am not such an ugly person, maybe I am just average, I know that there are people who are less attractive than me, probably there are people who even find me attractive, but I can't help but feel like the least attractive person in the world. I feel like every aspect of me is disgusting to other people. I want to stop being like this, I want to be a normal person who is not insecure about anything. I want to be able to relate to people without thinking their must be thinking I am horrible. *continue in comments*",

People always made me too nervous to ever land a date or pass a job interview. I am 33 and never had a paying job or even kissed a girl. What's required of me to reach a normal level feels overwhelming and might take more time than it feels like I have. I see a lot of posts by 20 year olds with similar worries and it freaks me out. I'm 13 years older and no further. How much of my life have I spent as a complete failure? Always had a feeling I wouldn't live that long anyway. Maybe this is my adjusted mid-life crisis, I don't know. Nice people tell me I'm still young but not nice people say I might as well be dead and that seems to hit harder.",

    "I hate being a people pleaser. Lately, I've been thinking about a guy. At first, he showed some interest, but when I started liking him back, he began to pull away. We're in the same friend group, so I can't completely avoid him. I've also realized that I have such low self-worth—I'm such a people pleaser, and I hate that about myself. I rushed things; I slept with him when I was drunk. We didn't have sex but cuddled and kissed, and we even spent the night and morning together, cuddling. Then, out of the blue, he became distant and didn't text me at all. I don't think he's interested in me, but it still hurts. Not because I really like him, but because I base my self-worth on how much he likes me.",
    "Why do people allow/encourage others to vent to them?. Recently I met someone online who told me I could rant to them anytime for the first time ever, and I felt so emotional at that moment because it always felt like nobody ever cared about what I had to say. I am not really the kind of friend that is good at comforting, but more just solving the issue for the friend. But people who allow strangers to vent to them, why do you do this? Personally, I get drained even from one friend venting, and I feel like my comfort won’t be useful or helpful at all to them.",

The teachers always act like nothing happened and they're always on their side. I can't tell my parents because they'll say I am inventing excuses, they threatened me to kick me out of the house.

So effortlessly pretty. I can’t even hold eye contact or speak to anyone because im so insecure. I genuinely believe people don’t speak o me because my face is atrocious.

Yesterday I was feeling insanely down with huge pain in the chest, I cried like a kid for 15 minutes then went out and bought cigarettes. Smoking a cigarette instantly fixes the pain and calms me down. Why is this bad? I’ve heard people saying I could just go out and sit instead of smoke but it doesn’t do it for me. Keep in mind smoking addiction isn’t an issue for me. I probably wont smoke now for another 6 months, and the first time I quit I did it with no problems.",

    "My mental health is failing.. I have been in law enforcement for 7 years. In February of 2023 I was the second on scene to a head on double fatality car accident. Both vehicles were near unrecognizable. I assisted the sheriffs office with CPR on one of the fatalities. He was so messed up and bloody I did not realize it was my best friend from where I live. His wife had already been picked up and hauled off to the hospital and survived. He left behind a young child a year older than mine. After the car accident I received help from my department in form of going to the therapist multiple times to talk about it. It has haunted me that I did not realize it was him until after the fact. I was never truly diagnosed but I am positive I have PTSD from this incident. I have tried to get on with life and deal with it. I find myself constantly going back to accident and it’s like a tape recorder hitting replay. My mental health is failing. I feel like I have no one to talk to and I’m so lonely. I try hard every day but I’m reaching my wits end, and I am wondering if anyone out there had something similar and how they came to cope with it. I understand it will never go away. I will have to live the rest of my life with those flashbacks. I just don’t understand why a year and a half later I am worse off than I was 3 months after.

I am feeling so happy. My medication really DOES take away the anxiety completely. I was thinking back to before I had taken it this morning. I was laying in bed, restlessly thinking about everything I had to do today, and wanting to do none of it. It was such an awful restless, dissatisfied feeling. I took my meds (all of them) and now I am at my Partial Hospitalization Program, listening to music and coloring happily in my coloring book. Yeah. It's basically a daycare with therapy lol.

    "Father Passed - I don’t feel as if I’m ‘grieving’. So I am 31 and my father was 89 and passed away a few days ago. I was living overseas when his health deteriorated quickly 6 years ago and I decided to move back and help my mum look after him. About a year later he broker his hip and needed full time care which neither of us could support financially, so he went into an Aged Care about 5 minutes away. My mum visited 6 times a week and I 2-3. We brought him home or took him out regularly. About 6 months ago he got ‘life ending’ pneumonia, but survived and became bed-ridden. All his teeth rotted, he has gangrene developing on his feet, malignant cancers on his head, a leaking sleeve on his aortic aneurism, chronic renal failure and was in the last stage of heart failure. I had started to become a little resentful that he was holding on when his quality of life was so poor and in turn, that was stopping myself or my mum from living our lives. Her house has become to big for her, she needs back surgery, the cost of care was punitive (though still better than not working and being on government support) - I was too scared to move away or go on holidays in case something happened. About a two weeks ago he lost his ability to swallow and has visions of his parents and knew it was time. We both sat with him in alternating shifts, day and night until the time came. I cried once or twice, but not because he was dying, but in instances where his pain wasn’t managed effectively and he was suffering. I love my dad and did not want it to be an agonising road to the end. Once he passed, I came in to see him and I felt relief that it was over and he was at peace. Now, I don’t feel numb or sad, I just feel that 89 is a very good age, he had a good life, I did my best to make sure he passed comfortably and that death is a fact of life. My mother and brother are grieving much more than I am, so I have been doing all the government paperwork, organising the wake and so on - my mum is also heavily involved in the wake, I am just doing all the admin stuff so she has time to grieve. Is there something wrong? I feel like I should be sad, upset, angry or something?",

    "Responding to Skinny Shaming Comments. So lately I’ve been going to the gym instead of walking outside everyday because of my allergies and the pollen count (I’ve been dying from ragweed..). So legit every morning around the same time like 8-11ish there’s a lady there (probs like 55-65) that’s a regular and talks to the front desk/the other regular older people there etc. I swear she wants to say something to me because she legit followed me around the whole time then got off machines literally at the same time I did (like after an hour and some change on the treadmill, then I moved and she moved) but like a few minutes later like if she was watching me and when I was going to be done.. this is like the third time it’s happened. I think why I’m anxious about it is because I have a feeling she’ll mention something about my weight or health state and get skinny shamed or questioned about my health/whats wrong with me since I’m at the gym and underweight. I switched to edge from planet for this exact reason because there was a person that talked to me about it and made me feel so insecure and uncomfortable that I should and hide and shouldn’t be there.

From more attention from girls to more respect from guys I really enjoyed the last couple years, after thought though I realised the long term consequences were too much to risk and asked for help, after a while we landed with a nutritionist who basically told my parents to feed me tons and tons and never give me any time alone or let me have ANY control over what I eat.

    "For anyone who needs it. Recently, my partner (22) broke up with me (32m). While we were together they were actively going through an eating disorder. It was not diagnosed, but it seemed to be showing up as habits of bulimia. While I have not fully recovered mentally from my anorexia, physically I have been stable for nearly two years. They would consistently ask me for advice how to deal with eating disorders and what my experiences in recovery were. If I'm being realistic I brushed the questions off at the time because I was afraid that talking about it would trigger my physical habits again. I'm not going to sit here and let anyone feel like they can't talk to me anymore. Remember that these are just my opinions. -I don't know if it's possible to recover fully mentally or not. I haven't been able to make it there and most days it seems like I never will. But I hold out faith every day that I'll look in the mirror and see someone handsome. Sometimes he's pretty cute. -When you're at your lowest, people are not judging you. They just want you to be healthy. -If you're here for a loved one, just try and be gentle with them at all costs like I couldn't be. It might seem simple to some but you could start to hurt more than you help. -You are loved and you are worthy of love. There are people who were in your life before that care whether you believe it or not. There are people who will love you at any size you might be. Just try to stop focusing on the ones that do base their love on that. -I know that I said I haven't fully recovered yet but it can be easier. I won't even say it gets better because it doesn't. It's something that you need to fight for. It's a hard fight. A lot of days you'll want to give up, and you might even relapse. The fact that you're even here reading this in the first place is proof that you have the fight in you. And I can promise you once you do start to feel better, it's worth it. Being skinny can feel great, but knowing that strength feels better. I'm sure all of this has been said here before, in many different ways, possibly even the exact same way. If you are seeing words like this for the first time though, welcome. I had to read things like I just typed so many times to get where I am. If this helped you, save it. If you want to reach out to me, do it. And to the one person who I actually want to see this post, I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you. This isn't trying to make anything better, I just need to be a better person.",

    "Is this normal dietitian behavior? Thinking about quitting.. (TLDR at end) This is the second dietitian I've been to. The first one was a disaster and my current one isn't as bad but the appts feel frustrating. They are an hour long and most of the time we don't even talk about food. We talk about my life and my mood (for context I have bipolar, ADHD, and ARFID) which feels more like she's trying to be my therapist than my dietitian. She tells me ways I should think and had made me repeat her words. I said, \"I'm bad at tap.\" She asked why I replied I needed more practice. She then made me repeat \"I won't say I'm bad at something when I need more practice\" it's irritated me especially when she went on a tangent about having a mindset of practice vs winning. I have to basically teach her about my disorder. She has barely any sense of what ARFID is let alone any eating disorders. We do kind of talk about exercise. I'm a dancer so I'm like explaining dance classes in our session. I just feel like its no help. I am only three sessions in but the appointments just frustrate me and I'm just glancing down at the clock every ten minutes wondering why we're talking about something random. We have small goals. Like try an apple. Eat before noon. But I feel like I dont need her help to make goals like that. My partner feels of more help than she does. Is this typical how your dietitian appointments go? Should I leave her? I'm thinking about skipping the whole dietitian part all together. TLDR: my dietitian seems to try to want to be my therapist and has barely any knowledge of my ed so I mostly have to explain everything to her. She also does demeaning things like make me repeat her words. We barely talk about food and her goals are something I could be doing on my own. Is it worth sticking with it?",

I am overweight so most of my issues are “disordered eating”, in the past two weeks overall I’ve had 4 cheese sticks, 3 tablespoons of peanut butter and a lot of water and energy drinks as they’re my staple to grab. At first it was depression triggering the “I don’t deserve to eat because it’s all I do” (it’s not, depression is a bitch.), then it turned into the current being afraid of eating. I ate a tablespoon of PB today and got instantly nauseous, I walked around Walmart hoping to gain some sort of appetite because I feel like I’m just dragging through today, as I result I started feeling nauseous at even the thought of food.

Similarly it could be the ED telling I need to know how much I weigh, and that could become excessive. So in ED recovery, how can you tell what is a positive thought, and what's possibly not?",

So I feel like I’ve made an ‘agreement’ with her and now we maintain the same weight, we have snack days then back straight to my routine. Where does the Ed come from ?",
    "Succesful bulimia recovery BUT….. I’m in successful bulimia recovery, I haven’t selfharmed and binged &amp; purged in over five months BUT I still have the immense urge to feel stuffed. Like I’m really looking forward to the feeling of the overstuffed stomach. I’ve always loved the feeling, but only for a mere second because right after the binged I needed to get rid of it. And I don’t do that anymore. I feel so sneaky - like a cheater almost - feeling the need to find ways how to trick this to make it easier, to find the smarter way for me even if I know it’s not the right one. I created this habit that I drink huge amounts water - like over 6 liters a day so I feel like I’m stuffed. And I use way too much salt. Too much that I’m actually concerned for my health. It’s over 20g daily, and I know and it’s just because to feel the food in myself for longer. Just to make the taste stronger so it’d have stronger aftertaste and I’d be “tasting” it in me for longer. Or the same goes with spices. I can eat 20 g of cinnamon to create the illusion of this cinammony food sloshing in my stomach. Or pepper or chilli flakes… I’m just so embarassed to pass my uneaten food to someone because they just tadte it and choke on the flavors I added… well fuck the embarassment. It’s more about my health at this point… What do I do? Has anybody had the same problem…? I don’t wanna stay like this. I’ve come such a long way already",

However, I’m getting weighed in a month and while I feel like I can get close to where I’m supposed to be, I feel so horribly guilty for lying to my family. Recently I’ve been wanting support but I can’t be honest about the numbers. If I’m honest about where I am genuinely, they’ll pull me out of law school and I don’t think I could function with that failure. However I feel awful lying about my weight in the meantime.

    "Advice on how to start eating again, please. So, something happened Monday this week that made me feel very self-conscious about my body, I had already been feeling really discouraged because I gained a lot of weight after taking certain meds for depression and ordering delivery often because of, well, depression. So this thing happened on Monday and I felt so guilty for even thinking about eating. That day, I didn't eat because I was too sad but next day, I tried and I just couldn't, I felt so disgusted even though I was hungry, the following days that feeling just grew and now I have not been able to eat a thing since a week ago, only drinking water. I want to start eating again even if it's something small because my family is worried, I tried today and broke down in tears because I felt guilty, almost as if I didn't deserve to eat. How do you guys cope with that if it happens to you? How do you push away those thoughts even if for a few minutes while you eat? I'll appreciate any advice you can give me because I want to try, really 🙏🏻",
    "How to find a new reason to recover?. I’m a daycare teacher and a little over a year ago I had a huge wake up call that I no longer had the strength or energy to take care of the kids as well as I used to. That’s the day I decided to try recovery. The entire time through treatment for anorexia my only motivation was to get well enough to be able to take care of the kids at daycare. It’s been one of the toughest journeys I’ve ever been on and I thought it would get easier. Now though my daycare has announced that at the rate we are losing teachers we very well could close any day. Unless we can get new hires my daycare is going to shut down sooner or later. And with that announcement it immediately triggered my ED. I genuinely don’t know how to continue trying to recover if my daycare closes. Any day now they can tell us not to come back the next day and we’re done. How do you find a new reason to recover? When shit hits the fan how do you not fall back on old coping mechanisms?

    "Accidentally relapsed and not I can't stop. I work two very physically intensive jobs (think on my feet for 8+ hours running around like a chicken with me head cut off) and I tend to only eat when food is provided to me after work otherwise I will literally forget. Literally just forget. I am autistic so this is kind of normal unfortunately but I wish it wasn't. I don't have a scale at my house because I've been in recovery for about a year (this time around) and I knew that a scale would fuck that up. So I don't know if I've lost or gained weight ever and I tend to just push it out of my mind but recently my coworker commented that I had lost a lot of weight and it really freaked me out and I began to get into the headspace of 'lose lose lose' and my partner noticed that I was a little off. I told them and they told me that it was true. Eating one meal a day and some candy a few times a week wasn't cutting it. I don't know what to think. I thought it was. It has in the past but not anymore and I walked into the bathroom today without a shirt on and I looked at my stomach and was like \"holy shit, I look skinny\" And it's terrifying. Because I don't want to relapse. I want to be healthy and maintain but at the same time I want to badly to be skinny. My partner and I might be getting physical soon and I can't help but imagine how much more attractive I will be to them if I were thin. They've seen me without a shirt in person and on Instagram but this just feels different and I know that if I just start getting veggies instead of rice and meat I will lose so, so fast but I dont want to.

    "A little lost seeking guidance. Hi, some of this may be out of scope for the reddit but I don’t have the resources to speak to a therapist atm. I'm a 22y/o male and just hovering at the underweight category. I started noticing I have some weird behaviors around obsessing over scale weight, and was using excessive running/cardio to try and compensate. I seem to have gotten back to the activities I like (lifting) and stopped excessive cardio. I’ve been lifting for the last 10 years mainly just for the love of it, and realized I was only doing cardio to try and burn cals. I’m still struggling with the balance between clean eating/being afraid of gaining weight/gaining fat, obsessing over the scale but also wanting to gain more freedom with food/gain some more muscle and gain some strength. My thoughts are to try and start incorporating more “cheat” foods as kind of exposure, keeping cardio to a minimum ( so it doesn’t become excessive). The thing that’s tricky is not being afraid to gain weight, I’ve even told myself that I would allow myself to go on a cut if I gained a certain amount of weight and wasn’t happy with how I looked but I still struggle with seeing weight gain as a “negative” even if I know it isn't the case. I also don't know how much weight I should \"allow\" myself to gain (mainly for psychological reasons to help in committing to getting more food freedom). Maybe a better idea would be to commit to a number of days or something? Idk if y'all have any thoughts/advice to try and chunk it up into smaller exposures of recovery if you will. sorry for the long essay but any advice would be super appreciated.

    "Struggling and need advice. Idk if anything I say might be triggering so here’s a blanket TW ab weight talk and restriction (Sorry in advance for the long post. TLDR at the end) I (22F) have been overweight my entire life and have always been insecure. About two years ago, a family friend saw me for the first time in a little while and said that it looked like I had lost weight. I hadn’t really lost much but I guess I maybe had lost fat and gained muscle. This quickly led to me restricting more and more to keep it off and run with that momentum of losing weight until it became a fear of gaining any weight. I never got formally diagnosed with anorexia but have struggled with disordered eating since then. After a year of this, I had lost a significant but still not insanely unhealthy amount of weight but I was obviously miserable. To make it all worse, I couldn’t seem to get lower than a certain weight but I was too scared to lower my calorie limit more than I already had bc I didn’t want to lose control bc I’ve always known ab the long-term effects of severe restriction. I finally gave in and started seeing a nutritionist to try and get over that plateau bc I had messed up my metabolism so much that any extra calories was noticeable on the scale the next day. With her help, I got my daily calorie limit up and introduced some fear foods back into my diet slowly and i stopped weighing myself and only using a tape measure. I kept track and ended up losing a bit more off my measurements even with a higher calorie goal and more “scary” foods. I have not been able to see her for around six months now and have slowly entered “recovery” but at the same time, ive never gone to psychological therapy for my disordered eating and now im weighing myself again and can feel myself slipping and feel the fears becoming louder than they have been in a while. With the help of my fiancé (who I met around the time I started to get worse), I was able to keep myself from spiraling to the point of needing hospitalization or anything bc he would hide calorie information from me and when I ate scarier foods and didn’t blow up like a hippo, I felt a little less scared of those foods. Lately, I’ve gained weight some weight but not inches and I’m struggling with dealing with the numbers and ignoring the voices in my head telling me it was easier when I was still restricting more than the calorie deficit I am still in. I’m still maintaining the calorie deficit i established with my nutritionist but idk what’s going wrong. I work as a CNA in a nursing home which is a very physically demanding job so I do burn a decent amount of calories doing that but idk what is going on. TLDR: I’m struggling to not go back to my old habits after gaining a bit of weight. Any advice on how to fight those voices and not fall back into my old behaviors? I’m worried that if I start restricting again I will lose control and go back to my disordered habits.",

I’m 23 and I’ve been struggling with anorexia on and off for the past 4 years with a recent relapse in February that’s gotten a bit better in the last month. But even before that, I always had a really hard time with my body. I always felt too big, and I’m short which makes it even more difficult. Since developing anorexia it’s been so much harder because I just feel like I have no idea what I actually look like. I believe my body right now is mostly average but it’s such a fight to keep it there and not get bigger. the most prominent feeling is just exhaustion. I wake up every day prepared to spend the day fighting to keep my body from getting bigger, constantly thinking about what I’m allowed to eat and how much I’m allowed to eat and being afraid of not restricting enough. I haven’t been restricting as much in the last few months and I’m not in a place where I love my body but I’m in a place where I feel like I’ll probably be OK if I don’t get any bigger.

I felt good and bad when people said i look skinnier. I hope they didn’t think i was ugly before, it gave me the impression that i should keep going.

I saw my engagement photos and the beginning of the year and haven’t been the same since. I feel unrecognizable. But I know this is my recovered weight.

    "Think I have ARFID. [ARFID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant/restrictive_food_intake_disorder) is \"is a feeding or eating disorder in which individuals significantly limit the volume or variety of foods they consume, causing malnutrition, weight loss, and/or psychosocial problems.\" This describes my entire life. I don't have any body image issues, and I'm not depressed or lethargic. I just don't enjoy cooking and eating. I find it to be a boring chore. So I'm too underweight and I need to eat more. The problem is, I can barely eat a full meal anymore. I was recently at an event with a food truck, and while everyone had one or two full meals, I could barely eat half of my plain fries. I think I'm somewhat malnourished. Can anyone else relate to this? I'll likely see my doctor, but I'm just wondering if I'm not alone with this problem. I don't know anyone in my life who can relate.",
    "How to Best Support a New Partner Recovering From an ED. Hey all this is my first time posting here so let me know if this is the wrong sub. Anyway on to the story. A girl I have been seeing recently confided in me that she is recovering from an eating disorder. I had noticed she got really stressed at a restaurant and asked her what was wrong. That’s when she opened up about it. I was hoping to get some perspective on things your partners did that were helpful or supportive of healthy eating habits. As well as some things to avoid. I already know some basic things like avoid talking about weight/ calorie content of food. To be honest I never really talked about those things anyway. It’s not my place to judge what people eat or how much they weigh. However I also like to show affection by giving/ making food for people I’m seeing. I know I should ask her directly about it, but how do you feel when partners do that for you? Maybe it’s something I should avoid entirely.",
    "Do laxatives affect muscle growth?. Hey all, I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, so apologies in advance.. I have been struggling with various EDs (mainly restricting ones) over the past 7 years - it keeps evolving. I’ve gotten into a good/bad habit of eating enough food, and my diet is overall healthy, but since I’ve developed a serious biscuit addiction, I’m often stuck binging before bed. So sadly, I’ve started taking laxatives every night - in order not to let the snacks digest properly. Furthermore, I’m extremely active - strength train and do cardio every morning. My goal is to build muscle and generally become stronger. But since the laxatives prevent the food I eat from being digested properly, does that affect potential gains?",
    "My boyfriend has an eating disorder and he’s only getting worse. I (18m) have been with my boyfriend (18m) for only 4 months ish so far but I’ve known about his eating disorder (For context he has an b/p and arfid btw) since the first or second date we went on and I was always concerned but I was able to feel kind of hopeful because he seemed dead set on recovery, maybe not all at once but he seemed like adamant to at least want therapy. Then about 3 months later he seemed to finally be content with just getting worse, and I am aware that is likely because he is just comfortable with me now and probably isn’t bothered to get better anymore but I just feel so upset that this is happening. Around this time I did once send him a long paragraph detailing how I wanted him to get better and I knew he wouldn’t get better for himself so I said (I know it wasn’t smart to ask but I felt desperate) to try to recover for me or his friends, or just anyone because I knew he wasn’t going to do that for himself; he obviously turned it down and told me this was his normal and he didn’t think he could ever get better, especially without support. Now he has gotten so bad that he can’t go outside without feeling faint and he has gotten himself sent to A&amp;E due to passing out at school as he hadn’t eaten anything and had purged everything he had already, he had also went out with his friends and had to have one of them carry him to his bus stop because his heart beat was so intense and he was about to faint, he has also cancelled our dates many times due to this and today he cancelled our date as we missed our movie and decided to weigh himself to see if he deserved to go out or not (and the verdict was to not haha, it’s not funny but I’m laughing) — this is all in one week. He has been trying to give me an ‘out’ a lot recently, telling me if this is too much and it’s making me miserable that we need to talk about our relationship and I don’t have to stay, I want to stay I never want to leave him and it makes this so hard. Today when he cancelled bc of his body issues he asked if I was angry and I answered honestly, I was tired of constantly having him cancel and me being left disappointed (I know that’s selfish but I don’t care I couldn’t help being upset and I think it’s fair that I was especially since I hate when plans are cancelled last minute and he hates it too lol) Anyways I’ve been crafting a damn letter to send him because at this point he is not just severely disordered he is dying, and I’m scared that he will not be able to function one of these days and he seems to not even care. I’m not meaning to sound bitter but I am just trying to get this out and be as honest as I could be so I could get some helpful advice which is; If you struggle with an ed or your loved one has how did you deal with it? I know there’s realistically nothing I can say to ‘fix’ him but what can I do to help? Any sort of advice at all is appreciated Thank you",
    "How to food shop for someone with anorexia and bulimia?. Hi all, my partner has a lifelong ED but is also in treatment for leukemia and needs more than ever to keep weight on. Their doctors are threatening to hospitalise them if they don't gain weight in the next two weeks. Since the leukemia diagnosis we have had an on and off agreement where I would remind them to eat a few times a day and make sure they had suitable snacks around. But lately whenever I try to do any food shopping for them or suggest they have a small meal I get \"it's ok, I've eaten today\" or \"I ate yesterday\". I don't know whether I'm better off backing off and not making them associate me with pushing food or to just buy some small meals anyway to make sure there's food in the house if and when they're open to eating. Not doing anything feels neglectful but doing something when they don't want me to feels abusive. I will do what's best for them regardless of my own feelings, I just don't know what that is.",

    "question about overshoot weight. Hi everyone, TW: bodies, weight I have posted some positive content about recovery on here before, but as a lot of us know recovery is not all positive and very up and down. One thing that always bring my mood down is my overshoot weight. I keep clinging onto the idea that it will go down. I feel like I can't be happy until it is gone. I know I have a lot of work to do but I am posting this hoping for some helpful advice or to feel less alone. For context, my eating disorder started January 2023. I started quasi recovery and slowly gained from January 2024 to April 2024. Then I decided to fully recover in May so I weight restored and overshot by June. I had constant extreme hunger for around 2 months. I got my period back in May and have gotten it monthly ever since. I am currently practicing intuitive eating and relearning to eat again. I get most of my cues, but satiation is still kind of hard. I am able to exercise pretty intensely as well which is nice because I am a college athlete and my sport is very important to me. I feel like my hunger levels are not normalized yet, but very close. Anyway I got new stretch marks and have never felt so unconfident and uncomfortable with my body. My boobs are huge, my stomach still holds lots of fat, and my face is so much chubbier. I just don't feel like myself. It sucks. And I get so angry when people just say \"love yourself\" \"weight neutrality\" like you can say that but I don't think anyone would feel comfortable if they just woke up and weighed significantly more. I know everyone's body is different and no one knows the answer but does anyone think my overshoot will come off? What did you guys notice when or if your overshoot came off? How long did it take? My weight has been stable for over 3 months now and I am just so sick of it. I have noticed some weight distribution but not much. Is anyone in the same boat as me? How do you stay hopeful? I don't think I will turn to my eating disorder again because I did all this hard work to get here, but I guess I just constantly want to fast forward to when maybe my set point is found and I feel like myself again. Also for context I don't mean like loose a bunch of weight when I say loose my overshoot- I just mean the extra amount that I gained. I didn't feel like myself in my underweight body, but I also don't in my overweight body. Any tips or stories will really help me! Sending love to anyone struggling.",

    "all in or binging?. i have anorexia and binge disorder. i go through long stages of restriction, then i literally get exhausted of starving myself and from day to night i start eating everything i wouldn’t allow myself to. i used to get so happy and feel it was really easy for me to recover, i would let go of my anorexia habits relatively quickly. the problem is that after that i begin to eat a lot and i replace the restriction with overeating to soothe uncomfortable feelings. i go from being terrified of being full to terrified of being hungry. when im in a restrictive stage i become really strict and lose weight fast, and when i stop doing that i eat as much as i can and i gain the weight back faster than i had lost it. its never ending and i feel trapped. i know the way to avoid binging is feeding yourself consistently, but it is so confusing sometimes. i feel like there’s such a fine line between honoring your hunger without judgement and using food to cope. has anyone ever experienced this? how do i break the cycle?",
    "constantly hungry in recovery. so ive been recovering from a restrictive ed (officially diagnosed as OSFED because I'm not underweight) and compulsive exercise for a few months. it wasn't really until the last month or so that i started to make mental progress, when i started to cut down on exercise. I've started getting hunger cues again and have been eating consistently throughout the day, albeit i still have tons of food rules, fear foods, and in general am afraid to eat \"too much.\" i think I'm kind of in quasi recovery, idk. however, in the last week or so, i noticed that i am SO hungry. i don't think its extreme hunger, because if eat a large meal or portion I'm satisfied. the thing is, I'm scared to do that, so i stick to my safe foods, safe portions, safe meal times, etc., and i have been getting hungry SO soon after meals! i think I'm just not used to this, as i used to be able to go x amount of time without feeling much hunger. i now wake up with hunger pangs and it feels like every meal just goes right through me. i also struggle incorporating snacks because eating lunch was a huge step for me in the first place and it feels impossible to now eat a snack or even two before/after lunch. i don't know, i guess I'm just scared because my brain is telling me that amount of food isn't necessary. I'm not underweight, I'm technically eating enough calories i think, and while I'm exercising, I've cut it down a bit. (so my brain tells me i should be less hungry) has anyone experienced this?? i know the solution is probably to eat more, but I'm very scared of weight gain. any advice on how to approach this, even advice on how to reframe it in my mind?? thank you &lt;3",
    "Not sure if my daughter has a problem. I'm the mom of a 16 year old girl, and I'm worried about binge like behavior. She has ADHD and I know that eating issues are common in people with ADHD because of impulsiveness. The medication also messes with your appetite so your not hungry in the morning and then starving when it wears off. But she has been extremely picky with food lately, but if I get something she likes she will eat a ton of it in one siting. Example: today I noticed a bag of tortilla chips was 3/4 gone and guacamole tub similarly gone while unopened yesterday. There are lots of food I can't keep in the house or she will just eat all of it in a day. I find hidden candy wrappers in her room. She sneaks to the kitchen after I go to bed and eats more at like 11pm. She also has anxiety and will vomit if too anxious (not related to food I don't think). She's a healthy weight and we're not a family that is restrictive about food or ultra healthy. We've been pretty normal till now. Does this sound like she has an issue?",

Now I'm 17 and I am recovered, however I feel really strange. A couple weeks ago I went to the beach with some people who I didn't know and the thought of being in a bikini in front of other people stressed me so much that I ended up having a small \"relapse\", it only lasted a few days, in which I redownloaded every calories/fast tracker apps, skipped meals ecc, but then I forced myself to stop. Now things are different, I eat without problems lunch and dinner and overall i'm okay. Still, I can't get myself to eat whenever i'm not \"forced\" to (I usually have lunch and dinner with my family so it's hard for me to skip those meal) but I won't eat snacks when I'm hungry and I'm always skipping breakfast, since nobody looks after me in those times. I don't know how to feel. I'm afraid this behave will lend to a relapse eventually and I don't know if I have the strength to handle it.

    "Did anyone find Equip to be financially sketchy?. hi, sorry if this might be a bad first time post, but I suffered from binging and addiction to certain food substances.

And I have a private insurance plan the coverage isn't the best. But let's just say to do this equip program for the And a half months of the year I would have to pay about $3500 which is my out-of-pocket for the year. That would be a bit of a financial stretch for me and I let the program know this, So my admission counselor came back to me with an offer That her \"manager approved\" I find this completely insane. Tell me if I'm Reading this wrong. They're telling me that I could spread that 3500, For essentially 3 1/2 months of the program (Because that's all I can commit to) Over 12 months of payments, At $559 per month.

    "My friend thinks I have an eating disorder. Hello, this is my first post on reddit. I don't know where else to go, really. I'm 22, and I've been through a lot of intensive therapy and multiple treatment centers for mental health issues, and this year I finally feel like I've recovered enough to go about normal life, and I'm managing my symptoms leagues better than I was. Basically, I have been through so much therapy and treatment and pretty much managed all of this (except financial support) by myself. I really don't want to go to another treatment center or make people spend more money on me. Recently, one of my friends has been very worried about me. I've lost quite a bit of weight so far this year. I have cut out a lot of sugar, and small treats I might have eaten throughout the day, and I pretty much only eat when other people invite me to go out or when dinner is ready when I get home. I somewhat count calories, but I just try to guesstimate them. Anyway, I've had this problem for years. Years and years, sometimes it gets worse and sometimes it gets better. Nothing has been done about it, other than my old therapist trying to help with my self esteem and body image. The only change this year is that in January, I started taking Adderall. I have pretty strong ADHD and it's been a life changer, Ive been accomplishing a lot more than i would without it, and I feel like I finally have my life back. I'm finally motivated to do stuff I used to love and go outside and do fun stuff. But my friend thinks I've been able to deny myself more food and work myself harder with it, and I've lost lots of weight because of that. The past couple of months have been really rough, mentally and physically. I feel like I'm on the verge of passing out a lot of the time, and I can't move too fast or I just straight up can't see. I feel really dizzy sometimes, and I wake up and go to sleep with headaches. I'm so tired all the time, but I find it hard to sleep. My menstrual cycle is irregular and painful and I've been experiencing weird hormonal symptoms, like acne and severe depression at the start of my cycle. This is really embarrassing to admit for me, because I never talk about this type of stuff, but I guess that shows you how shitty it is lol. In the past, when I was losing weight because of lack of appetite but I was literally rotting in bed because of depression and never getting outside, any concerns about my eating habits that I brought up were quickly brushed off because I was apparently the perfect picture of health (medically). My blood work was fine, my vitals were fine, etc, even though i was experiencing similar symptoms like lightheadedness and headaches, even severe joint pain. I was told to exercise more and eat healthier foods, maybe take vitamins. Now, everything is so much worse. I feel like shit all the time. I work outside doing physical labor and sometimes I wonder if I'll actually pass out at work, but apparently lately I'm the shining picture of health. I'm still consistently losing weight, but my family has told me they are proud of me for being so active and getting into shape and taking care of myself, and I feel a lot more beautiful than I did. I feel more comfortable wearing the clothes I want to. The only person who really knows about this is my long distance friend, who has actually taken my eating habit concerns seriously since day 1. She has been checking in daily making sure I've actually eaten anything and not just had water, milk, and yogurt. She's been trying to get me to see a doctor. She also says in the little videos I send her she can see that I've lost weight, like my hands and neck seem a lot thinner. But I'm in such deep denial about this and I'm so afraid of having some other problem that will financially burden my family. My dad's girlfriend (I live with him and her, they're great) has a kid that used to have an eating disorder really badly, and the few times I've brought up my \"eating problem\" she sort of talks about how eating disorders are really severe and hard to miss, and how her kid literally counted every single chip they ate. I don't, I just look at the box and round up, then I have a quota I have to stay in depending on if I work really hard that day or not. Maybe I'll do a quick Google search and see if whatever I'm eating is too much. Either way, I don't really think I have an eating problem as severe as an actual disorder. I'm sort of casual about it in comparison to what I hear eating disorders are like, and I'm not emaciated skinny. In fact, I still feel like I look a little overweight, haha. I don't want to seek help for this if people are just going to tell me it's not a big deal, because that will be really embarrassing and humiliating. It's hard enough for me to admit i have a problem in the first place. Im definitely not asking for a diagnosis, I know only professionals can do that. I'm just asking if I should actually seek help for this problem, and if I should go to like, an actual eating disorder specialist or just a normal therapist. I really really don't want anyone to laugh at me or be upset that I am wasting their time with some small problems when their whole job is taking care of people who need actual immediate help. If you have actually read this, thank you for bearing with me. I'm a bit of a yapper, sadly.",

    "How do people cope with the softness of skin and flesh?. This may be a me issue, but I can't stand the feeling of softness at all. A big factor in my eating disorder has always been the hatred for the warm softness. It just feels so wrong and vulnerable and naked. When I used to grab at my bones in stressful situations, I felt safe. I felt hard and sharp and like there was nothing but hardness in me. I know that people need a certain amount of fat and flesh to survive and thrive, but it just feels so wrong. It feels way too tender. Even people with a lot of muscle are soft when they aren't actively flexing and I can't fathom being able to stand that. Do people not get the hives and an urgent feeling of danger when they touch their arm and find flesh? When they touch their torso and there's flesh? Genuine question. I've always assumed that the feeling of security that comes with being hard as a rock and sharper than a razor is universal, and that so is the feeling of incoming doom that comes with not being those things. I feel like I'd feel safe and confident only in an exoskeleton, perhaps I should have been born a spider lol.",
    "help staying physically healthy following and ed. Hello! I had issues with food and starving myself a few years ago, and I'm currently trying to improve my physical health. However, I've noticed I don't really know where to start and my mind instantly goes to thoughts and habits I had while I was struggling with food because that's what i considered good and \"healthy\" for so long. I've tried looking at calorie calculators to see how many calories i should be eating in a day according to my height, age, weight, sex, etc., though the number to maintain my weight was significantly lower than I thought it would be which scared me. All I want to do now is put myself in a calorie deficit. I've finally reached a healthy weight and feel really good about my body, all I want is to be more active and be more selective about the foods that I eat so I can physically *feel* better. But knowing that I could lose a few pounds and still be within healthy weight for my height/sex/age is just making me feel fat. I've always liked relying on numbers and I don't know how to change my body/health without relying on calories and weight. I'm so scared to eat anything when I'm anywhere near the recommended calories for me. I know i should stay away from the numbers and calculators, but it's the only way I know how to track my progress and know how much to eat. I feel good about the way that my body looks, I'm just far too fixated on what my scale says. I feel good about myself then feel like shit when I remember how much I weigh even though it's healthy for me. I've been missing the familiarity of my disordered eating days and the routine of it all for the past few months, and I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts and get back to a healthier mindset while also working to eat better and work out more. The way things are going, it feels like I have to start starving myself again. I know how to do it, I don't know how to actually be healthy. I'm just so scared of gaining weight and I feel like it's inevitable seeing the way that people older than me have gained weight as they entered their twenties. Any advice is appreciated!",
    "Idk what to do…. I started doing this recently where I forget to eat. Make food when I think I’m hungry and don’t eat it or right when I’m done making it, I’m not hungry? Idk what this is lol but I don’t think I have an ed… I’ve forgotten to eat for the whole day multiple times before as well. I find eating as an inconvenience idk-",
    "Struggling to eat enough. I have ARFID so I hope it's okay to post here. I thought you guys might be able to give me some tips and ideas on how I can increase my caloric intake. I found out I had high cholesterol so I started tracking different numbers for my meals and I realized from this that I wasn't eating enough at all. Because of the ARFID, I don't eat a lot of meats, beans, etc. but I just can't figure out how to eat a low saturated fat diet while still eating enough food. How do I just keep eating when I'm not hungry? Hard to get over the aversion part but I'm trying to at least eat my safe foods, minus the ones that aren't good for my cholesterol levels :( I know you can't give me a definite answer that will work for my individual situation but any advice or experience sharing would really help me out!",
    "Recovery. So I am eight months in recovery! It certainly has not been easy. Yesterday I didn’t eat well and I feel awful. But I did not B&amp;P!",
    "Possible eating disorder. I want to vomit when thinking about food. To start out, I don't weigh alot. I am actually just underweight. This is not a choice i made or the cause of any diet. I have always been a selective eater, That coupled with a fast metabolisim and an active life style, it is very hard for me to gain weight. All of this to say, eating is very important for me, if I miss a meal or even put one off for an extra hour, i become shaky, i have cold/hot flashes, i will get sudden bursts of nervous energy, and feel generally sick like a flu. Lately (the past year and half) I have started having trouble deciding what to eat. Randomly, there doesn't seem to be much of a pattern, I want to throw up at the thought of food. It is as if I am force feeding myself. I know I need to eat, and my body will suffer the consequences of not eating. But its like my stomach has no idea its empty. I am not the most versatile eater, but i make sure I eat with some mind to the food spectrum. On a weird note, I have noticed distraction helps. Like watching youtube while eating makes it easier. Or my amazing supportive friend, sometimes will just keep me company and talk to me while I try to finish. This doesnt happen every day, but when it does, I really do think I am about to throw up. For the record, I sincerely don't think I am an anorexic, I have not actually thrown up yet, although i have come close. And I do NOT want to trade my physical health just to look skinny. I actually would like to gain weight. I remember weighing a healthy amount for a short while and would like to get back up there. I have no idea why this has become an issue for me. ANY help will be greatly appreciated.",
    "In constant fear of it coming back. How do you live with that? I recently found out that most of my boyfriend’s exes are thinner than me and this brought back all these feelings and fear of my anorexia coming back He tells me he prefers me, that he thinks I am much hotter for having big breasts or hips but I feel that disgust towards these parts of my body creeping in I have considered myself “recovered” for years but I am always afraid something will trigger it coming back",
    "Disordered eating, BED, support please. TW/ weight, no numbers, exercise I’ve (23f) been in treatment for my eating disorder (binge/restrict) since February. It’s had a lot of ups and downs and I’ve learned a lot but man it’s so difficult. I have gained some weight and that’s really triggering for me. I haven’t weighed myself in months but I was concerned that I was gaining weight and so my dietician did a blind weight and clearly didn’t tell me the number but we did discuss that it’s more than when we did my intake. I already knew that thought I could feel it in my body. I’m trying so hard to not go back into my cycle. Sometimes I feel like if I could just lose some weight then I could start again and maintain it. I know that’s not logical though and the way I’ve been doing things for so long (I’ve had these struggles since I was in junior high) hasn’t worked. My weight has yoyo’d significantly throughout the years. Eating consistently isn’t so much the problem as just wanting to change my body is. Summer was really hard with that while wearing less clothing and even as it’s getting cooler I feel like I don’t know how to dress myself. My disordered eating therapist and I have also been talking about movement and trying to make goals around that because I’ve only ever really used it as a way to change my body and not for any other reason. I want to start working out again at the gym but I’m scared on top of doing it for my mental health and my stamina and physical health there is also that voice in the back of my head saying if I do it maybe I’ll start to “tone up”… it always goes back to wanting to change my body. I also haven’t even tried dating or talking to guys since November after I had a bad experience and I am starting to feel like I want to put myself back out there but I’m scared that I can’t even accept my body the way it is how will someone else? And that also makes me want to change it. I could really use some words of encouragement and some advice if anyone has experienced these thoughts/ feelings/ and struggles. Thank you so much in advance."
